## Survey Response Structure

```
Paragraph 1: Opinion Statement
Paragraph 2: First Reason + Example
Paragraph 3: Second Reason + Example
Paragraph 4: Conclusion (optional, if time permits)
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Option (30 seconds)
- Read all options quickly
- Pick one you can support easily
- Don't overthink - there's no "right" answer

### Step 2: State Your Opinion Clearly
```
I believe that [Option A] is the best choice because...
In my opinion, [Option B] is preferable for several reasons.
I strongly support [Option A] for the following reasons.
```

### Step 3: Give First Reason + Example
```
First of all, [reason]. For example, [specific example from
personal experience or general knowledge]. This shows that...
```

### Step 4: Give Second Reason + Example
```
Furthermore, [reason]. To illustrate, [another example].
This demonstrates why [option] is beneficial.
```

### Step 5: Conclude (if time)
```
In conclusion, [option] is clearly the better choice because
[brief summary of reasons]. Therefore, I recommend...
```

## Example Response

**Prompt:** Should companies allow employees to work from home?
- Option A: Yes, always
- Option B: Yes, but only sometimes
- Option C: No, never

**Response:**
```
I believe that companies should allow employees to work from
home sometimes, which is Option B. This balanced approach
offers the best of both worlds.

First of all, working from home improves productivity for
focused tasks. For example, when I need to write reports, I
can concentrate better at home without office distractions.
Studies also show that remote workers often accomplish more
in less time.

Furthermore, regular office time is important for teamwork
and company culture. In my experience, brainstorming sessions
and team meetings are more effective in person. Face-to-face
interaction builds stronger relationships among colleagues.

In conclusion, a hybrid approach allows employees to be
productive while maintaining team connections. Companies
should offer this flexibility to attract and retain talent.
