:::tip[How to Use These]
1. **Don't overload** — use 3–5 boosters per response, not one per sentence
2. **Match the register** — formal boosters for formal prompts, moderate ones for casual prompts
3. **Practice in pairs** — learn one booster per category and use it until it's automatic
4. **Speak naturally** — if a booster feels awkward in your mouth, swap it for a simpler one you can deliver smoothly

:::caution[Common Mistake]
Using boosters you can't pronounce or don't fully understand will hurt your score more than using simple words clearly. **Clarity beats complexity.**
