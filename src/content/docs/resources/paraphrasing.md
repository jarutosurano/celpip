description: Tips, techniques, and examples for effective paraphrasing in CELPIP Speaking and Writing
---

Paraphrasing — restating someone else's idea in your own words — is one of the most tested skills in CELPIP. It shows up in **Reading** (recognizing paraphrased answers), **Writing** (restating prompts), and **Speaking** (rephrasing questions in your responses). Master it and you gain an edge across all four sections.

## Why Paraphrasing Matters in CELPIP

- **Reading:** Correct answers are almost always paraphrases of the passage, not exact quotes
- **Writing:** Repeating the prompt word-for-word lowers your score; restating it in your own words raises it
- **Speaking:** Echoing the question back shows comprehension and buys thinking time
- **Listening:** Answer options rephrase what you heard — you need to recognize the match

## Five Paraphrasing Techniques

### 1. Synonym Swap

Replace key words with synonyms while keeping the meaning.

| Original | Paraphrased |
|---|---|
| The city **implemented** new rules | The city **introduced** new regulations |
| This **significantly reduced** costs | This **substantially lowered** expenses |
| Children **benefit from** outdoor play | Children **gain advantages from** playing outside |

:::tip[Watch Out]
Not all synonyms are interchangeable in every context. *"Make"* and *"manufacture"* are synonyms, but you don't *manufacture* a decision. Always check that the swap sounds natural.
:::

### 2. Change the Word Form

Shift between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

| Original | Paraphrased |
|---|---|
| The **decision** was difficult | **Deciding** was difficult |
| They responded **quickly** | They gave a **quick** response |
| The program is **beneficial** | The program provides **benefits** |
| She **contributed** generously | Her **contribution** was generous |
| The results were **surprising** | The results came as a **surprise** |

### 3. Change the Sentence Structure

Rearrange clauses, switch active/passive, or flip the order.

| Original | Paraphrased |
|---|---|
| **Because** it rained, the event was cancelled | The event was cancelled **due to** the rain |
| The company **fired** 200 workers | 200 workers **were let go** by the company |
| **Students** enjoy the new library | The new library **is enjoyed by students** |
| **After** finishing the report, she left | She left **once** the report was finished |
| The manager approved the plan **before** the deadline | **Prior to** the deadline, the manager approved the plan |

### 4. Break or Combine Sentences

Split a long sentence into two, or merge two short ones.

**Splitting:**
- Original: "The new policy reduces waste and saves the company approximately $50,000 per year."
- Paraphrased: "The new policy cuts down on waste. It also saves around $50,000 annually."

**Combining:**
- Original: "The park was renovated last year. It now attracts more visitors."
- Paraphrased: "Since the park was renovated last year, it has been attracting more visitors."

### 5. Use Different Connectors

Swap the linking words while keeping the logical relationship.

| Original Connector | Paraphrased Connector |
|---|---|
| because | due to / since / as a result of |
| but | however / nevertheless / yet |
| so | therefore / consequently / as a result |
| although | despite / even though / in spite of |
| if | provided that / as long as / assuming |

## The 3-Step Paraphrase Method

Use this when you need to paraphrase on the spot:

1. **Read** the original and identify the core meaning (ignore exact words)
2. **Look away** and say the idea in your own words
3. **Check** that your version keeps the same meaning, strength, and scope

:::caution[Three Paraphrasing Traps]
1. **Changing the meaning** — "may help" paraphrased as "will solve" changes the strength
2. **Just swapping one word** — "The city implemented new rules" → "The city implemented new regulations" is too close; change the structure too
3. **Making it longer than the original** — Good paraphrases are roughly the same length or shorter
:::

## Practice Drill

Take any sentence from a news article and:

1. Identify 3 key words → find synonyms
2. Change at least one word form (noun → verb, adj → adverb)
3. Restructure the sentence (swap clause order or switch active/passive)
4. Read your version aloud — does it sound natural?

Do this with 5 sentences a day and paraphrasing will become automatic within two weeks.
