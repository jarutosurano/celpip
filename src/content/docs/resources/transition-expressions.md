description: Essential linking words and phrases to connect your ideas smoothly in CELPIP Speaking and Writing
---

Transition expressions are the glue that holds your ideas together. Using them correctly shows the examiner you can organize thoughts logically — a key scoring criterion in both **Speaking** and **Writing**.

## Adding Information

Use when you want to build on a point:

- *Furthermore* / *Moreover* / *In addition*
- *Additionally* / *What is more*
- *Not only… but also…*
- *On top of that* / *Besides*
- *Another key point is…*
- *Equally important…*
- *Along the same lines…*

**Example:** "Public transit reduces pollution. **Moreover**, it eases traffic congestion during rush hours."

## Contrasting Ideas

Use when switching to an opposing or different point:

- *However* / *Nevertheless* / *Nonetheless*
- *On the other hand* / *In contrast*
- *Conversely* / *On the contrary*
- *Although* / *Even though* / *Despite* / *In spite of*
- *While* / *Whereas*
- *That said* / *Having said that*
- *Be that as it may*

**Example:** "Remote work offers flexibility. **However**, it can lead to social isolation for some employees."

## Giving Reasons & Causes

Use when explaining why:

- *Because* / *Since* / *As*
- *Due to* / *Owing to* / *On account of*
- *The reason for this is…*
- *This is largely because…*
- *Given that…* / *Considering that…*

**Example:** "Many students prefer online courses **due to** the flexibility they offer."

## Showing Results & Effects

Use when explaining what happened as a consequence:

- *Therefore* / *Thus* / *Hence*
- *Consequently* / *As a result* / *As a consequence*
- *For this reason* / *Accordingly*
- *This leads to* / *This results in*
- *This means that…*

**Example:** "The city invested in cycling infrastructure. **As a result**, bicycle commuting increased by 40%."

## Giving Examples

Use when illustrating a point:

- *For example* / *For instance*
- *Such as* / *Including*
- *To illustrate* / *To demonstrate*
- *A case in point is…*
- *One notable example is…*
- *This can be seen in…*

**Example:** "Many cities have adopted green policies. **For instance**, Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025."

## Emphasizing a Point

Use when you want to stress importance:

- *Indeed* / *In fact* / *As a matter of fact*
- *More importantly* / *Most significantly*
- *It is worth noting that…*
- *What stands out is…*
- *Above all* / *Particularly* / *Especially*
- *Without a doubt*

**Example:** "Exercise benefits physical health. **More importantly**, it has a profound impact on mental well-being."

## Comparing & Showing Similarity

Use when drawing parallels:

- *Similarly* / *Likewise* / *In the same way*
- *By the same token* / *Along similar lines*
- *Comparable to* / *Just as… so too…*
- *In a similar vein*

**Example:** "Tokyo has an efficient rail system. **Similarly**, Seoul's subway network is known for its punctuality."

## Sequencing & Ordering Ideas

Use to structure your argument step by step:

**Opening:**
- *First of all* / *To begin with* / *First and foremost*

**Middle:**
- *Secondly* / *Next* / *Then* / *Subsequently*
- *Following this* / *After that* / *In addition*

**Closing:**
- *Finally* / *Lastly* / *Last but not least*
- *To conclude* / *In conclusion* / *All things considered*

**Example:** "**First of all**, the policy reduces costs. **Secondly**, it improves efficiency. **Finally**, it benefits the environment."

## Summarizing & Concluding

Use when wrapping up:

- *In conclusion* / *To conclude* / *To sum up*
- *In summary* / *To summarize*
- *All in all* / *All things considered*
- *On the whole* / *Overall*
- *Taking everything into account*
- *In light of the above*

**Example:** "**All things considered**, the advantages of remote work clearly outweigh its drawbacks."

## Conceding a Point

Use when acknowledging the other side before reinforcing your stance:

- *Admittedly* / *Granted*
- *It is true that… however…*
- *While I understand that… I still believe…*
- *I acknowledge that… nevertheless…*
- *Despite this* / *Even so*
- *Notwithstanding*

**Example:** "**Admittedly**, the initial cost is high. **Nevertheless**, the long-term savings make it worthwhile."

## Clarifying & Rephrasing

Use when restating for clarity:

- *In other words* / *That is to say*
- *To put it differently* / *To put it simply*
- *What I mean is…*
- *To clarify* / *More specifically*

**Example:** "The policy is counterproductive. **In other words**, it creates more problems than it solves."

## Conditional Expressions

Use when talking about possibilities:

- *If… then…*
- *Provided that* / *As long as*
- *In the event that* / *Assuming that*
- *Unless* / *Otherwise*
- *In case*

**Example:** "The project will succeed **provided that** all stakeholders contribute equally."

## Quick Reference by Task

### Speaking (all tasks)
Keep it natural. Best transitions for speech:
- **Adding:** *Also, On top of that, What's more*
- **Contrasting:** *However, That said, On the other hand*
- **Concluding:** *Overall, All in all, So basically*

### Writing Task 1 (Email)
Match formality to context:
- **Formal:** *Furthermore, I would like to add, With regard to*
- **Semi-formal:** *Also, In addition, On another note*

### Writing Task 2 (Survey Response)
Structure your argument clearly:
- **Para 1:** *First of all, To begin with*
- **Para 2:** *Moreover, In addition, Furthermore*
- **Para 3:** *In conclusion, All things considered*

:::tip[The 3-Transition Rule]
For any speaking response or writing paragraph, aim for **at least 3 transitions**:
1. One to **start** (First of all…)
2. One to **add or contrast** (Moreover… / However…)
3. One to **wrap up** (Overall… / Therefore…)

This creates a clear structure the examiner can follow easily.

:::caution[Don't Stack Transitions]
Avoid: "However, on the other hand, in contrast…" — one transition per shift is enough. Stacking them sounds unnatural and wastes time.
