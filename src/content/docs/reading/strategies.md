## Core Reading Skills

CELPIP Reading rewards three kinds of processing: **global** (big picture), **local** (one precise detail), and **inferential** (a conclusion the text points to but doesn't state). These four skills wire those habits into your approach.

## Skill 1: Skimming for Gist (30–40 seconds)

Capture the passage's core idea, structure, and stance fast — so later choices have context.

1. **Lead lines first** — Read the first sentence of each paragraph (they announce the topic or shift)
2. **Flag contrast markers** — *however, although, whereas, on the other hand, still*
3. **Name the sections** — Tag each paragraph with one word (e.g., Problem / Evidence / Counterpoint / Recommendation)
4. **Check the edges** — Title, caption, footnotes; in diagrams: legend + units
5. **One-line gist** — Say it: "This is mostly about ___, arguing that ___ because ___"

:::caution[Skim Pitfalls]
- **Detail drag:** Skip examples and numbers during skimming — you'll verify later
- **Scope drift:** Your gist should cover the whole passage, not one paragraph you liked

## Skill 2: Scanning for Anchors

Jump straight to the line that answers a Specific Information item and prove it with the text.

**What counts as an anchor** (won't paraphrase):
- Proper nouns: names, streets, programs, agencies
- Numbers & formats: 12:30 pm, $14.50, June 21, 3 lanes, Unit 5B
- Exact labels: FoodSafe Level 1, Permit 27-B, Line 980

**Micro-routine:**
1. Extract the constraint string from the stem: e.g., "≥3 lanes, after 7 pm, weekdays"
2. Hunt the anchor: scan vertically for the number/label/time
3. Read ±1 sentence around it
4. Verify every constraint — one mismatch = reject

:::danger[High-Frequency Traps]
- **Digit flips:** 12 vs 21; $13 vs $31
- **Time windows:** before/after/until/from; am vs pm; weekday vs weekend
- **Unit swaps:** km vs m; per day vs per week
- **Scope creep:** a rule for "temporary staff" becomes "all staff" in a wrong option

## Skill 3: Paraphrase Recognition

Recognize when a choice is the same idea in new words vs. a meaning change disguised as a synonym.

### Safe Paraphrases (meaning preserved)

| Category | Swaps |
|----------|-------|
| Cause/effect | because ↔ due to ↔ owing to; therefore ↔ so ↔ thus |
| Contrast | however ↔ but ↔ nevertheless ↔ even so |
| People | residents ↔ people who live here; staff ↔ employees |
| Money/time | cost ↔ fee ↔ charge; free ↔ at no charge; schedule ↔ timetable |
| Change | increase ↔ rise ↔ grow; decrease ↔ drop ↔ decline |

### False Friends (meaning changed)

| Looks Similar | Actually Different |
|--------------|--------------------|
| must / required | ≠ should / recommended |
| will | ≠ may / might / could |
| free | ≠ discounted / reduced |
| exactly | ≠ at least |
| only (restrictive) | ≠ especially (emphasis) |
| some (at least one) | ≠ most (more than half) |
| by 5 pm (≤ 5:00) | ≠ until 5 pm (period ends at 5:00) |
| not until 5 pm (nothing before) | ≠ no later than 5 pm (any time up to) |

### The Three Switches

Every option has three switches that must match the passage:

1. **Strength** — must → should → may (don't upgrade or downgrade)
2. **Scope** — all → most → some → few (don't widen or narrow)
3. **Polarity** — watch *not, only, except, unless, before, after, by, until*

If any switch moves, the option is wrong — even if the topic matches.

## Skill 4: Tone and Purpose Detection

**Tone signals:**
- **Hedges** (soften): *may, might, tends to, appears to*
- **Boosters** (strengthen): *clearly, definitely, certainly*
- **Attitude verbs:** *appreciate, regret, recommend, oppose*
- **Register cues:** "Hi Alex… Thanks!" (informal) vs. "Dear Sir/Madam…" (formal)

**Purpose quick-labels:**
- **Inform** — explain a process, announce a change
- **Request** — ask for action, information, confirmation
- **Persuade** — argue for a policy, recommend a decision
- **Complain** — report a problem + request remedy

:::tip[Function Test]
"If I reply to this writer, what would I do?" If you'd perform an action → request. If you'd form an opinion → persuade.
:::

## When to Infer vs. "Not Stated"

| Infer | Not Stated |
|-------|-----------|
| Text gives clues pointing to a conclusion | The idea genuinely doesn't appear anywhere |
| Takes one small logical step | Would require outside knowledge or stacked assumptions |
| "Evenings are crowded" → crowding is common after work | "A pilot runs for two weeks" → the city will expand it next year |

**Three filters:**
1. **Text-only rule** — If you need outside knowledge, it's not safe
2. **One small step** — If you're stacking assumptions, stop
3. **Global sweep** — Check all paragraphs; confirm absence before choosing Not Stated

## Answer Engineering: Eliminate Like a Pro

You don't win by "feeling" the right option — you win by **disqualifying wrong ones fast**.

### The Four Wrong-Answer Types

| Type | What It Does | Tell |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Outside Scope** | Goes beyond what the text discusses | *all, always, everywhere* where passage is narrower |
| **Over-Strong** | Upgrades hedges (*may* → *will*) | Absolute language passage doesn't use |
| **Misaligned Speaker** | Assigns a claim to the wrong voice | Right idea, wrong person |
| **Time/Quantity Mismatch** | Breaks number, time, or unit logic | Looks right at a glance, fails digit-by-digit |

### The Five Kill-Tests (stop at first fail)

1. **Finger-on-Text** — Can you point to the exact line/cell that supports it?
2. **Strength Match** — must/should/may levels identical?
3. **Scope Match** — Same people, time, place, quantity?
4. **Polarity & Logic** — *not, only, except, before/after/by/until* all correct?
5. **Speaker/Stance** — Right voice, right intensity?

### The ACE Quick Filter

On first read, tag each option:
- **A (Aligned)** — Matches text. Keep and verify.
- **C (Contradicts)** — Conflicts with the text. Eliminate.
- **E (Extra)** — Adds claims not in the text. Eliminate.

Trash all C's and E's, then run Kill-Tests on surviving A's.

### Tie-Break Rules (when two options survive)

1. **Closest wording** to the actual text wins
2. **Fewer assumptions** wins
3. **Specific support** beats "whole passage vibe"
4. **Moderate** beats extreme

### Every-Item Playbook

1. Tag the question G/S/I
2. ACE filter on all options
3. Finger-on-text for survivors
4. Check Strength, Scope, Polarity
5. Verify speaker/stance
6. Choose (tie-break if needed)
7. Over 90 seconds? Pick best guess, mark for Pass 2

:::tip[Speed Moves When Time Is Tight]
- **Numbers first** — one digit mismatch = instant kill
- **Nuke absolutes** — *always/never/only/must* unless the text matches
- **Prefer hedges** — options with *may/might/some* when the passage hedges
- **Nearest neighbor** — between two survivors, pick the one using more of the passage's own words
