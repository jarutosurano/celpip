## Test Structure

The Reading test has **4 parts** with **38 questions** total. Each part has its own timer — time does not carry over between parts.

:::note
The test moves **forward only**. Once a part ends (by clicking next or when the timer hits zero), it locks and you cannot go back.
:::

## Test Environment

- **Centre-based only** — desktop computer with mouse, keyboard, headset, and notepaper + pen
- **One screen per part** — passage and questions share the same page (scroll between them)
- **Visible countdown timer** per part
- **Within a part**: Move freely between items, change answers anytime
- **Across parts**: Forward-only, locked once completed

:::tip
Your notepaper is collected at the end and is not scored. Use it freely for constraint strings, paragraph labels, and opinion maps.

## Part Breakdown

### Part 1: Reading Correspondence (11 questions, ~11 min)
- **Content:** A short email/message + a reply with drop-down blanks
- **Skills:** Understanding purpose, tone, specific details; completing the reply with correct facts and register
- **Question mix:** Mostly Specific Information + some General Meaning

### Part 2: Reading to Apply a Diagram (8 questions, ~9 min)
- **Content:** A timetable, map, price table, or flowchart + a message with drop-downs
- **Skills:** Matching constraints to exact cells/rows/segments; reading footnotes and legends
- **Question mix:** Almost all Specific Information

### Part 3: Reading for Information (9 questions, ~10 min)
- **Content:** An informational passage split into paragraphs A–D + nine statements
- **Skills:** Matching statements to paragraphs or choosing "Not Stated" (E)
- **Question mix:** Specific Information + Inference, plus Not Stated decisions

### Part 4: Reading for Viewpoints (10 questions, ~13 min)
- **Content:** An opinion article (author + contrasting viewpoints) + a reader comment with drop-downs
- **Skills:** Tracking multiple speakers' stances; inference; tone and attitude
- **Question mix:** Heavy Inference + some General Meaning

## The Three Question Types

Tag every question before answering — this tells you **how** to read:

| Type | What It Asks | How to Read | Trigger Words |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **G — General Meaning** | Main idea, best title, overall tone/purpose | Skim paragraph openings + contrast markers | *mainly, primarily, overall, best title, main purpose, tone* |
| **S — Specific Information** | One concrete fact (who/when/where/how many) | Scan for anchors (names, numbers, dates) | *according to, which, how many, what time, where, who, in paragraph X* |
| **I — Inference** | What's implied, suggested, or likely agreed with | Read the claim + its context carefully | *implies, suggests, most likely, can be inferred, would agree* |

:::caution[5-Second Decision Tree]
- Does the stem ask for the overall idea, purpose, or tone? → **G**
- Does it ask for one concrete thing (name, number, date, paragraph)? → **S**
- Does it use words like *implies, suggests, likely, can be inferred*? → **I**
- If mixed, pick the highest-precision tag (a date or name = S, even in a long sentence)

## Answer Types

| Format | Where It Appears | How It Works |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Multiple-choice (one correct)** | All parts | Click a single option; saved immediately |
| **Drop-down blanks** | Parts 1, 2, and 4 | Complete a reply/comment; only one choice fits meaning + tone + facts |
| **Paragraph match / Not Stated** | Part 3 | Match statements to paragraphs A–D or choose E |

## Time Management

| Part | Questions | Target Time | Pacing |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1 — Correspondence | 11 | ~11 min | Map 1m → Facts 3m → Drop-downs 5.5m → Sweep 1.5m |
| 2 — Diagram | 8 | ~9 min | Legend 0.5m → Direct 4m → Multi-constraint 3m → Sweep 1.5m |
| 3 — Information | 9 | ~10 min | GPS 1.25m → Direct 4m → Tricky 3.75m → Sweep 1m |
| 4 — Viewpoints | 10 | ~13 min | Map 1m → Structure 6.5m → Inference 4m → Sweep 1.5m |

:::danger[Never Leave Blanks]
There is **no penalty** for wrong answers. A blank is the only guaranteed loss. If time runs out, eliminate two options and pick the survivor.
