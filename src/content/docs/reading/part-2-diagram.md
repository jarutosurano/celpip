## What Part 2 Is

You get a visual source (timetable, brochure table, map/zone chart, facility schedule, or flowchart) plus a short email/message to complete with **drop-down blanks**. Almost every question is Specific Information: match constraints to the exact cell/row/segment of the diagram. There are **8 items** with a target time of **~9 minutes**.

## The 5-Step Routine

1. **Title first** (2–3s) — What is this thing? The title tells you the scope
2. **Legend & Notes** (10–15s) — Read legends, units, symbols, and especially **footnotes**. Words like *only, except, not valid, reduced service, closed* flip answers
3. **Structure map** (5–8s) — How is info organized? Rows vs columns, time axis, zones, process arrows
4. **Constraint string** (5–10s) — From the stem, write a compact line: "≥3 lanes, after 7 pm, weekdays"
5. **Triangulate & verify** (15–25s) — Go to the candidate cell/row. Check **every** constraint, then ±1 cell for exceptions

## Diagram Types

### A) Timetables / Facility Schedules

- **Read first:** Title → legend (lanes, closures, "lessons use 1 lane") → days/time bands → footnotes
- **Common constraints:** Weekdays vs weekends; am/pm; after/before/until/from; lane counts; seasonal hours
- **Frequent traps:** Near-numbers (12 vs 21), am/pm flips, "until 6 pm" (excludes 6:00) vs "by 6 pm" (includes 6:00)

### B) Maps / Zone Charts

- **Read first:** Legend (colours, symbols), scale, zone boundaries, direction arrows
- **Common constraints:** Origin→destination zones; direction; transfer rules; peak vs off-peak
- **Frequent traps:** Misreading direction (to vs from Downtown), zone edge cases, dotted lines = weekend-only

### C) Brochures / Price Tables

- **Read first:** Column headers (Adult/Youth/Senior; Basic/Plus/Premium), rows, fine print
- **Common constraints:** Tier + add-ons + date/season + group size + refund rules
- **Frequent traps:** Bundled benefits, per-night vs total pricing, "from $X" = minimum not final

### D) Flowcharts / Process Diagrams

- **Read first:** Start node → decision diamonds (yes/no paths) → termination boxes
- **Common constraints:** Eligibility ("age ≥ 65"), timing ("apply within 14 days"), documentation lists
- **Frequent traps:** Jumping across branches; ignoring a "no" path; missing "both A and B required"

## Constraint Language Decoder

| Expression | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| only | No other cases allowed |
| except | Everything but that case |
| at least | ≥ (3 means 3 or more) |
| at most | ≤ |
| no later than 5 pm | ≤ 5:00 |
| not until 5 pm | ≥ 5:00, nothing before |
| between A and B | Usually inclusive unless a note says otherwise |
| per day / per week | Billing period matters — don't multiply wrongly |

:::caution[Units Matter]
Always confirm: km vs m, kg vs g, $ vs ¢, 12-hour vs 24-hour time. Write the critical word next to your constraint string.
:::

## Completing the Reply Drop-Downs

Structure: **acknowledge → confirm facts → next step**

Run all four tests on each blank:

1. **Meaning** — Insert the option, re-read the full sentence. Must respect every verified constraint
2. **Tone** — Polite/neutral unless the source uses formal register
3. **Strength** — Don't upgrade *may* to *will*, *should* to *must*, or *free* to *discounted*
4. **Grammar fit** — Subject/verb agreement, tense, prepositions (*on* Friday, *at* 6 pm, *in* Zone 3)

## High-Frequency Trap Catalog

| Trap | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Footnote ambush** | "Lessons use 1 lane 12–2" → your "2 lanes" window becomes 1 lane |
| **Near-match number** | $13 vs $31, 12:30 vs 12:03 |
| **Direction flip** | Eastbound table chosen for a westbound trip |
| **Border case** | Station on a zone edge charged as the higher zone |
| **Bundle illusion** | Premium includes locker+towel; Basic + separate add-ons costs more |
| **Per-night vs total** | Option multiplies when the table already shows total |
| **Weekday/weekend swap** | Saturday rules applied to Friday evening |
| **"From" pricing** | Minimum rate quoted as final price |

:::tip[Kill Rule]
When **one constraint fails**, discard the option immediately. Don't negotiate with it.
:::

## Decision Tests for Every Option

1. **Anchor test** — Can I point to the exact cell/row/symbol?
2. **All-constraints test** — Do all parts of my constraint string hold simultaneously?
3. **Units/time test** — Are units and time windows exactly right?
4. **Footnote test** — Is there any note that overrides this case?
5. **Reply consistency test** — Does the sentence still match tone, strength, and facts?

One failed test → eliminate.

## Timing Plan (~9 minutes)

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Global scan (title + legend + footnotes) | ~0:30 |
| Items 1–4 (straight factual matches) | ~4:00 |
| Items 5–7 (multi-constraint or footnote-heavy) | ~3:00 |
| Reply drop-downs + final sweep | ~1:30 |

## Quick Error Fixes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Missed a footnote | Force yourself to read legend/notes before touching options |
| Chose a near-match number | Read numbers digit-by-digit; say them in your head |
| Direction mistake | Write TO and FROM next to the map; circle the correct table |
| Zone border confusion | Check the rule for border stations |
| Per-night miscalculation | Confirm whether the table shows per-unit or total |
| Reply tone mismatch | Mirror salutation/closing style; avoid slang in formal notices |
