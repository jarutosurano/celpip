Tomorrow marks the beginning of my 1-week CELPIP preparation journey. Today, I'm getting everything ready.

## What I Did Today

1. **Created this diary** - You're reading it! Having a public commitment helps keep me accountable.

2. **Gathered all my resources** - Check out the [Resources page](/celpip/resources) for everything I'll be using.

3. **Set up my study schedule** - As someone with a full-time job, I need to be strategic:
   - Weekdays: 2 hours/day (morning + evening)
   - Weekends: 4-5 hours/day

## My Concerns

- **Listening**: I sometimes miss details on first listen
- **Speaking**: Keeping fluent without awkward pauses

## Tomorrow's Plan

Day 1 focuses on **Listening**:
- Morning commute: English podcast
- Lunch: Review strategies
- Evening: 2 practice tests

Let's do this! 💪
