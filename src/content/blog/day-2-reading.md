Today was all about **Reading** — and honestly, it was a lot more strategic than I expected. I went in thinking "I can read English fine, this should be easy," but CELPIP Reading isn't really about reading. It's about **verifying answers from the text under time pressure**.

## What I Learned Today

### The Three Question Types Changed Everything

The biggest unlock was learning to tag every question as one of three types before even looking at options:

- **G (General Meaning)** — Main idea, best title, overall tone. Skim paragraph openings.
- **S (Specific Information)** — Find one fact (name, number, date). Scan for anchors.
- **I (Inference)** — Read between the lines. One small logical step, not a leap.

This simple tagging system tells you *how* to read for each question. No more wasting time reading everything slowly.

### Each Part Has Its Own Personality

1. **Part 1 (Correspondence)** — An email + reply with drop-down blanks. I build a quick "Who → Why → Tone" map and extract constraints (times, amounts, conditions). The reply must match facts *and* tone from the original.

2. **Part 2 (Diagram)** — A timetable, map, or price table. The routine is: Title → Legend → Footnotes → Build a constraint string → Match it to the exact cell. Those tiny footnotes are where the traps live.

3. **Part 3 (Information)** — Four paragraphs A–D, nine statements to match. I label each paragraph with one word, then locate → verify → decide. The "Not Stated" option only applies when the idea genuinely isn't anywhere.

4. **Part 4 (Viewpoints)** — An opinion article with multiple voices. I build an "Opinions Map" tracking who thinks what and how strongly. Most questions are inference — watching for hedges like *may* vs. boosters like *clearly*.

### The Answer Engineering System

Instead of looking for the "right" answer, I learned to **eliminate wrong ones**. Most bad options fall into four categories:
- **Outside Scope** — adds claims the text never makes
- **Over-Strong** — upgrades *may* to *will*
- **Misaligned Speaker** — attributes a view to the wrong person
- **Time/Quantity Mismatch** — flips numbers, dates, or conditions

If I can't point to the exact line in the text that supports an option, I don't pick it.

### Paraphrase Traps Are Real

CELPIP almost never repeats exact wording. The key is checking three "switches" on every option:
- **Strength** — must / should / may (don't upgrade or downgrade)
- **Scope** — all / most / some / few (don't widen or narrow)
- **Polarity** — watch *not, only, except, until, by*

"*Free*" ≠ "*discounted*." "*No later than 5 pm*" ≠ "*Not until 5 pm*." These tiny shifts are where points get lost.

## My Pacing Plan

I'm targeting **11 / 9 / 10 / 13 minutes** across the four parts. The two-pass approach is key:
- **Pass 1**: Answer everything I can prove with a quick text check.
- **Pass 2**: Return only to flagged inference items.

No blanks ever — there's no penalty for wrong answers.

## What Surprised Me

- How much the **footnotes** matter in Part 2. A tiny note like "lessons use 1 lane 12–2" can invalidate what looks like a correct answer.
- How often wrong answers use the **right nouns but wrong connectors** (cause vs. contrast, before vs. after).
- How the **Opinions Map** in Part 4 basically answers half the questions by itself once you know who believes what.

## Tomorrow's Plan

Day 3 will tackle **Writing** — Task 1 (Email) and Task 2 (Survey Response). Time to switch from finding answers to producing them.
