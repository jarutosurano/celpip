description: "Boost your CELPIP Writing Task 1 score with a detailed email-writing template. Learn how to structure your email, add clarity, and showcase strong vocabulary."
---

## Goal

Write a professional, high-scoring email (150-200 words) by using a strict logical structure. You must demonstrate **Relationship Context**, clear **Paragraph Transitions**, and complex **Sentence Structures**.

---

## What the Examiner Looks For (Assessment Criteria)

| Criterion | What They Check |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Task Fulfillment** (Completeness) | Have you sufficiently addressed all three bullet points? To score high, you must develop your ideas fully with supporting details rather than just listing brief answers. |
| **Coherence & Cohesion** (Flow) | Logical sequencing with specific "signpost" phrases (*To briefly review*, *In terms of*, *Regarding*) that act as bridges between your paragraphs, making the email easy to read. |
| **Grammar** (Range & Accuracy) | Varied sentence structures — complex grammar such as Present Perfect to establish context ("I have been...") and Modals to express necessity or politeness ("Must," "Ought to"). |
| **Vocabulary** (Lexical Resource) | Range of words and tone. Avoid repetition and use precise, formal synonyms (e.g., "Dissatisfaction" instead of "Unhappy", "Inquire" instead of "Ask"). |

---

## Step 0: The Salutation (Analyze the Scenario)

**Goal:** Determine who you are writing to before you start. This decision dictates your **Tone** and your **Sign-off** at the end.

### The Rule of Pairs

In formal writing, your opening Salutation must match your closing Sign-off.

| Scenario | Who is it? | Salutation Template | Matching Sign-off |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Formal** (Unknown) | Manager, Company, Official | Dear Sir or Madam, / Dear Manager, | Yours Faithfully, |
| **Formal** (Known) | A boss or official whose name you know | Dear Mr. [Last Name], / Dear Ms. [Last Name], | Sincerely, |
| **Semi-Formal** | A neighbor, colleague, or acquaintance | Dear [First Name], | Best regards, / Best wishes, |
| **Informal** | A close friend or family member | Hi [First Name], | Love, / All the best, |

---

## Step 1: The Opening (Who & Why)

**Goal:** Introduce yourself, establish your authority/relationship, and state the general purpose of the email.

### Grammar Booster: Present Perfect Tense

Use this to prove your history with the recipient. It shows that your relationship started in the past and is still true today.

- **Formula:** Subject + Have/Has + Been + Noun/Adjective + For [Time]
- **Why?** "I am a tenant" is basic. "I have been a tenant for five years" demands respect.

### The Template

- **Context:** "My name is [Name], and I have been a [Resident/Customer] for [Duration]."
- **Purpose:** "I am writing to [express a concern / complain / inquire] regarding [Topic]."

!!! tip "Example"

    My name is Mahdie Ahmadi, and I have been a resident of unit 1207 for five years. I am writing to express a safety concern regarding the landscaping.

---

## Step 2: Bullet Point 1 (The Situation)

**Goal:** Provide the background story. "Set the scene" so the reader understands the context before you complain or ask for something.

### Grammar Booster: Simple Past & Passive Voice

When describing an event or order details, use the **Simple Past** (it is finished). Use **Passive Voice** to sound formal and objective (focus on the action, not the person).

- **Active:** I ordered the cake.
- **Passive (Better):** The order was placed on January 10th.

### The Template

- **Transition:** "To briefly review the situation,..."
- **Details:** [Describe what happened / The object / The date].

!!! tip "Example"

    To briefly review the situation, the large oak tree near the entrance has been deteriorating for months. This tree is excessively overgrown, with several large branches that appear dry and brittle.

---

## Step 3: Bullet Point 2 (The Problem/Details)

**Goal:** Explain the specific issues, hazards, or details. This is the "Meat" of the email.

### Grammar Booster: Subordinating Conjunctions (Complex Sentences)

Do not write short, choppy sentences. Use conjunctions to connect the Problem with the Result.

- **Contrast:** Although, While
- **Cause/Effect:** Since, Because, Consequently

### The Template

- **Zoom-In:** "In terms of [the hazard/problem],..."
- **Detail 1** (Complex Sentence): "The roots are uplifting the pavement, leading to a tripping hazard."
- **Detail 2** (Expander): "Furthermore, [Additional Detail]."

!!! tip "Example"

    In terms of the hazards it poses, the most pressing issue is that the roots are uplifting the pavement, leading to a tripping hazard. Furthermore, falling branches recently scratched a tenant's car, which raises liability concerns for the building.

---

## Step 4: Bullet Point 3 (The Solution/Action)

**Goal:** Provide the solution, request, or suggestion required by the prompt.

### Grammar Booster: Modals of Suggestion & Necessity

Be polite but firm. Avoid "I want." Use Modals to soften the request while keeping it strong.

- **Strong:** Must, Urge
- **Polite:** Would suggest, Could, Ought to

### The Template

- **Transition:** "Regarding [the solution/request],..."
- **Proposal:** "I strongly urge you to [Action]." OR "I would suggest [Action]."
- **Alternative:** "Alternatively, [Plan B]."

!!! tip "Example"

    Regarding a potential replacement, I strongly urge you to consider a facility that adds value. I would suggest installing a bike rack. Alternatively, a small flower garden could improve the curb appeal.

---

## Step 5: The Closing & Signature

**Goal:** End professionally using standard phrases. A missing name or signature is a major formatting error.

### Grammar Booster: Future Expectations

Use standard phrases that assume the person will do the job.

### The Template

- **Closing:** "Thank you in advance for..." OR "I look forward to..."
- **Sign-off:** [Matches Step 0 selection]
- **Name:** [Your Full Name]

!!! tip "Example"

    Thank you in advance for taking this matter into consideration.

    Regards,
    Mahdie Ahmadi
