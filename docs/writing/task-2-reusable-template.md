## The Template

Everything **outside** the brackets stays the same every time. Only fill in the `[BRACKETS]`.

```
To the [DEPARTMENT],

After careful consideration, I firmly support the proposal that
[OPTION A — passive voice (be + past participle)] rather than
[OPTION B — short]. While both options have merit, I believe
[OPTION A — short] offers superior benefits in terms of
[THEME 1] and [THEME 2].

First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support this
initiative is [THEME 1]. Currently, many [PEOPLE] experience
[PROBLEM] due to [CAUSE]. Consequently, if this plan is
implemented, it will allow [WHO] to [BENEFIT], significantly
reducing [NEGATIVE THING].

Additionally, this approach optimizes [THEME 2]. By [VERB-ING]
the [THING], the [ORGANIZATION] ensures that [BENEFIT]. It
provides a unique opportunity for [WHO] to [ACTION], which is
essential for [BROADER GOAL].

Admittedly, some [PEOPLE] might argue that [OPTION B] would
[ONE GOOD POINT]. However, [OPTION A] better suits our needs
because [FEATURE] can effectively address [THE CONCERN], making
it the more practical choice.

To sum up, based on the improved [THEME 1] and [THEME 2],
I strongly urge the [DEPARTMENT] to proceed with this plan.
```

    The template uses four different words for the same idea. Memorize this order:

    |----------|------|
    | Intro | **proposal** |
    | Body 1 start | **initiative** |
    | Body 1 middle | **plan** |

## Before You Write: The 2-Minute Setup

Before filling in the template, spend 2 minutes deciding:

| Step | Question | Write Down |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Which option is easier to support? | Option A or B |
| 2 | What is Theme 1? | e.g., well-being, cost, safety |
| 3 | What is Theme 2? (must be different) | e.g., productivity, morale, efficiency |
| 4 | What is one good thing about the other option? | e.g., prevents distractions |

!!! warning "Pick the Easier Option, Not Your Real Opinion"

    Choose the option you can support with two strong reasons — even if you personally disagree with it. The examiner scores your writing skill, not your opinion.

**Setup:**

| Step | Decision |

| Theme 1 | Employee well-being |
| Theme 2 | Productivity and retention |
