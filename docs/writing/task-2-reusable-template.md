```
To the [DEPARTMENT / COUNCIL / COMMITTEE],

After careful consideration, I firmly support the proposal that
[OPTION A — paraphrased using passive voice] rather than
[OPTION B — paraphrased in 3-5 words]. While both options have
merit, I believe [OPTION A — short version] offers superior
benefits in terms of [THEME 1] and [THEME 2].

First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support
[OPTION A] is [THEME 1]. Currently, [DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM NOW].
Consequently, if [OPTION A] is implemented, it will allow
[WHO] to [BENEFIT], significantly reducing [NEGATIVE ISSUE].

Additionally, this proposal optimizes [THEME 2]. By
[VERB-ING], the [COMPANY / CITY] ensures that [BENEFIT].
It provides a unique opportunity for [WHO] to [ACTION],
which is essential for [BROADER GOAL].

Admittedly, some [PEOPLE] might argue that [OPTION B] would
[ONE GOOD POINT]. However, [OPTION A] better suits our needs
because [REASON], making it the more practical choice.

To sum up, based on the [BENEFIT 1] and [BENEFIT 2], I strongly
urge [WHO] to proceed with [OPTION A].

## Before You Write: The 2-Minute Setup

Before filling in the template, spend 2 minutes deciding:

| Step | Question | Write Down |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Which option is easier to support? | Option A or B |
| 2 | What is Theme 1? | e.g., well-being, cost, safety |
| 3 | What is Theme 2? (must be different) | e.g., productivity, morale, efficiency |
| 4 | What is one good thing about the other option? | e.g., prevents distractions |

!!! warning "Pick the Easier Option, Not Your Real Opinion"

    Choose the option you can support with two strong reasons — even if you personally disagree with it. The examiner scores your writing skill, not your opinion.

---

## Example: Pet-Friendly Workplace

**Prompt:** Your company is considering implementing a new pet-friendly workplace policy. Choose Option A (allow pets) or Option B (maintain no-pets policy).

**Setup:**

| Theme 1 | Employee well-being |
| Theme 2 | Productivity and retention |
| Counter-argument | Allergies and distractions |
