title: "Task 2: Quick System"
description: "A brain-dead simple 3-step system for CELPIP Writing Task 2. Pick an option, pick 2 themes, fill in the template. No thinking required."
---

## The Whole System on One Card

```
1. PICK OPTION   → "Which one gives me 2 reasons in 10 seconds?"
2. PICK 2 THEMES → Well-being / Money / Convenience / Fairness / Environment
3. FILL TEMPLATE → Everything else is already written for you
```

That's it. The rest of this page explains each step.

---

## Step 1: Pick the Option (10 seconds)

Don't overthink. Ask yourself **one question:**

> "Which option can I give 2 reasons for **right now**?"

If you can't think of 2 reasons in 10 seconds, pick the other one.

!!! warning "Important"

    Pick the **easier** option, not your real opinion. The examiner scores your writing, not your beliefs.

---

## Step 2: Pick 2 Themes (20 seconds)

Don't memorize 10 themes. **Memorize only these 5.** They work for ANY prompt.

| # | Theme | It means... |
|---|-------|------------|
| 1 | **Well-being** | health, stress, happiness, quality of life |
| 2 | **Money** | cost, savings, budget, waste |
| 3 | **Convenience** | time, access, ease, availability |
| 4 | **Fairness** | equal access, all ages, inclusive, all demographics |
| 5 | **Environment** | green, waste, pollution, sustainability |

**Rule: Pick 2 from different rows. Never pick two from the same row.**

### How to pick: The Quick Test

For each theme, ask: "Does this connect to my option?" If yes, use it.

| Prompt about... | Usually works with... |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Workplace / Office | Well-being + Money |
| Community / Neighborhood | Fairness + Convenience |
| Health / Fitness | Well-being + Money |
| City / Infrastructure | Convenience + Environment |
| Education / Programs | Fairness + Well-being |
| Services / Facilities | Convenience + Fairness |

## Step 3: Fill in the Template

### Pre-loaded sentences for each theme

These are **ready-made** sentences. Just swap in the `[DETAILS]` that match your prompt. Everything else stays exactly as written.

---

#### If Theme 1 is WELL-BEING:

```
First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support this
initiative is community well-being. Currently, many [PEOPLE]
experience heightened stress levels due to [CAUSE]. Consequently,
if this plan is implemented, it will allow [WHO] to maintain
a healthier lifestyle, significantly reducing [NEGATIVE THING].
```

| Fill in | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| `[PEOPLE]` | residents / employees / students / families |
| `[CAUSE]` | demanding schedules and limited access to recreational facilities / long working hours and insufficient breaks |
| `[WHO]` | community members / staff members / all residents |
| `[NEGATIVE THING]` | stress-related health issues / mental fatigue and burnout / missed opportunities for physical activity |

---

#### If Theme 1 is MONEY:

```
First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support this
initiative is cost efficiency. Currently, a significant portion
of the budget is being allocated to [WASTEFUL THING]. Consequently,
if this plan is implemented, it will allow [WHO] to allocate
resources more effectively, significantly reducing unnecessary
expenditures.
```

| Fill in | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| `[WASTEFUL THING]` | maintaining underused facilities during off-peak periods / operating services with low attendance |
| `[WHO]` | the management committee / the municipal government / the organization |

---

#### If Theme 1 is CONVENIENCE:

```
First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support this
initiative is accessibility. Currently, many [PEOPLE] struggle
to access [SERVICE/FACILITY] due to [BARRIER]. Consequently,
if this plan is implemented, it will allow [WHO] to save
valuable time, significantly reducing scheduling conflicts and
inconvenience.
```

| Fill in | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| `[PEOPLE]` | working professionals / parents with young children / elderly residents |
| `[SERVICE/FACILITY]` | the community facility / essential health services / public transportation |
| `[BARRIER]` | limited operating hours / the current rigid schedule / insufficient availability |
| `[WHO]` | all community members / residents across all neighborhoods |

---

#### If Theme 1 is FAIRNESS:

```
First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support this
initiative is equitable access. Currently, certain groups are
underserved due to [CAUSE]. Consequently, if this plan is
implemented, it will allow all demographics to benefit equally,
significantly reducing disparities across the community.
```

| Fill in | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| `[CAUSE]` | the current one-size-fits-all approach / limited availability in underserved neighborhoods / a system that only accommodates certain schedules |

---

#### If Theme 1 is ENVIRONMENT:

```
First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support this
initiative is environmental sustainability. Currently, the
existing approach contributes to [WASTE/PROBLEM]. Consequently,
if this plan is implemented, it will allow [WHO] to reduce
its environmental footprint, significantly reducing [HARM].
```

| Fill in | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| `[WASTE/PROBLEM]` | unnecessary energy consumption during low-demand periods / excessive waste due to inefficient resource allocation |
| `[WHO]` | the community / the organization / the municipality |
| `[HARM]` | carbon emissions and operational waste / the strain on local ecosystems |

---

### Pre-loaded sentences for Body 2

Use the **same theme table** above, but swap to your Theme 2 and use this structure:

```
Additionally, this approach optimizes [THEME 2]. By [VERB-ING],
the [ORGANIZATION] ensures that [GOOD OUTCOME]. It provides a
unique opportunity for [WHO] to [ACTION], which is essential for
long-term [BROADER GOAL].
```

| Theme 2 | `[VERB-ING]` | `[GOOD OUTCOME]` | `[BROADER GOAL]` |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Well-being** | promoting a healthier lifestyle | residents maintain both physical and mental wellness | community health |
| **Money** | reducing operational costs during low-demand periods | funds are redirected toward facility improvements | financial sustainability |
| **Convenience** | streamlining the scheduling process | services are available when demand is highest | efficient resource management |
| **Fairness** | ensuring equal access for all demographics | no group is excluded from the benefits | an inclusive community |
| **Environment** | minimizing unnecessary resource consumption | energy and materials are used responsibly | environmental preservation |

---

```
Admittedly, some residents might argue that [OPTION B] would
[ONE GOOD POINT]. However, [OPTION A] better suits our needs
because [REASON], making it the more practical choice.
```

| More flexibility | offer greater flexibility to accommodate individual preferences |
| Saving money | reduce short-term operational expenses |
| More options | give residents more choices |

---

### Pre-loaded Intro and Conclusion

**Intro** (fill in 3 things):

```
To the [DEPARTMENT],

After careful consideration, I firmly support the proposal that
[OPTION A — passive voice] rather than [OPTION B — short].
While both options have merit, I believe [OPTION A — short]

## Full Example: Community Pool Hours

**Prompt:** The pool management is considering seasonal hours (Summer: 5 AM–10 PM, Winter: 7 AM–8 PM) vs. keeping fixed hours (6 AM–9 PM year-round).

### The 3 Steps

| Step | 10 seconds | Decision |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1. Pick option | "Seasonal hours — I can argue summer access + winter savings" | Option B |
| 2. Pick themes | Well-being + Money | Two different rows |
| 3. Fill template | See below | ~195 words |

### Filled-in Answer

> To the **[pool management committee]**,
>
> After careful consideration, I firmly support the proposal that **[seasonal operating hours be adopted for the community pool]** rather than **[maintaining the current fixed schedule]**. While both options have merit, I believe **[seasonal adjustments]** offers superior benefits in terms of **[community well-being]** and **[cost efficiency]**.
>
> First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support this initiative is **[community well-being]**. Currently, many **[residents]** experience **[limited opportunities for physical activity during summer evenings]** due to **[the pool closing at 9 PM while daylight extends well past that hour]**. Consequently, if this plan is implemented, it will allow **[families and working professionals]** to maintain a healthier lifestyle, significantly reducing **[missed opportunities for exercise and recreation]**.
>
> Additionally, this approach optimizes **[operational cost efficiency]**. By **[reducing hours during the low-demand winter months]**, the **[management committee]** ensures that **[utility and staffing expenses are minimized during periods of low attendance]**. It provides a unique opportunity for **[the saved funds]** to **[be redirected toward facility maintenance and improvements]**, which is essential for long-term **[financial sustainability of the pool]**.
>
> Admittedly, some residents might argue that **[fixed year-round hours]** would **[provide consistency and predictability for regular swimmers]**. However, **[seasonal adjustments]** better suit our needs because **[they align operating costs with actual usage patterns while maximizing access when demand is highest]**, making it the more practical choice.
>
> To sum up, based on the improved **[community well-being]** and **[cost efficiency]**, I strongly urge the **[pool management committee]** to proceed with this plan.
