description: "Boost your CELPIP Writing Task 2 performance with this clear survey-response template. Learn how to pick an option, organize your ideas, and write a concise, impactful answer."
---

## Goal

Write a persuasive survey response (150–200 words) expressing a clear opinion on a specific topic. You must demonstrate **Persuasive Language**, **Complex Argumentation**, and **Contrast**.

---

## What the Examiner Looks For (Assessment Criteria)

| Criterion | What They Check |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Task Fulfillment** (Relevance) | You must choose one option and stick to it. Do not sit on the fence. You must also acknowledge the opposing side (the counter-argument) to show critical thinking. |
| **Coherence & Cohesion** (Flow) | The examiner looks for specific Transitions of Contrast (*Admittedly*, *However*) and Addition (*Additionally*, *Furthermore*). |
| **Grammar** (Range & Accuracy) | You must demonstrate Complex Sentences (using *Since*, *If*, *Unless*) and Passive Voice to sound objective. |
| **Vocabulary** (Lexical Resource) | You need strong persuasive verbs (*Optimize*, *Foster*, *Ensure*) and topic-specific vocabulary rather than repeating the words from the prompt. |

---

## Step 0: The Setup (Analyze the Options)

**Goal:** Choose the option that is easier to support with logical reasons, even if it is not your personal opinion.

### The Rule of 3

Before writing, quickly identify:

1. **Reason 1** for your choice (e.g., Convenience)
2. **Reason 2** for your choice (e.g., Cost-saving)
3. **One positive aspect** of the other choice (to use in your counter-argument)

---

## Step 1: The Introduction (Stance & Paraphrase)

**Goal:** State your opinion immediately and paraphrase the context using formal grammar.

### The Paraphrasing Toolkit

To paraphrase effectively, do not just change one word. Use a combination of these four strategies to completely rewrite the prompt while keeping the same meaning.

| Strategy | Definition | Original (From Prompt) | Paraphrased (Your Intro) |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Passive Voice** | Focus on the action, not the actor. Change Subject + Verb to Be + Past Participle. | "The school is considering adding a new course." | "I strongly support the proposal that a new driving course **be added** to the curriculum." |
| **2. Synonyms** | Replace common words with higher-level formal vocabulary. | "The city is deciding between building a garden or a playground." | "The council intends to **construct** a communal **green space** rather than a **recreational area**." |
| **3. Parts of Speech** | Change the form of the word (e.g., turn a Verb into a Noun). | "The company wants to train employees in the city." | "The **training** of employees locally is the superior choice for staff **development**." |
| **4. Word Order** | Move the clauses around. Start with the "Why" instead of the "What." | "We should choose the program because it helps the environment." | "**Due to** its significant environmental benefits, the recycling program is the preferred option." |

### The Template

- **Opening:** "To the [City Council / Manager / Department],"
- **The Hook:** "After careful consideration, I strongly support the proposal that [Option A be implemented] rather than [Option B]."
- **The Roadmap** (Optional): "While both proposals add value, I believe [Option A] offers broader benefits regarding [Theme 1] and [Theme 2]."

!!! tip "Example (Using Passive Voice + Synonyms)"

    **Prompt:** "The boss wants to give everyone a bonus."

    **Your Answer:** "After careful consideration, I strongly support the proposal that financial incentives be distributed to all staff."

---

## Step 2: Body Paragraph 1 (Primary Argument)

**Goal:** Present your strongest reason. Focus on the main benefit (Efficiency, Money, or Community).

### Grammar Booster: Cause & Effect (Conditionals)

Use "If/Then" logic or strong connectors to show the positive result of your choice.

- **Formula:** If + [Action], + [Result].
- **Connectors:** Consequently, Therefore, As a result.

### The Template

- **Topic Sentence:** "First and foremost, the most compelling reason to support [Option A] is [Concept: Time Efficiency / Cost Effectiveness]."
- **Explanation:** "Currently, [Describe the problem with the status quo]."
- **Result** (Complex Sentence): "Consequently, if [Option A] is implemented, it will allow [Stakeholders] to [Benefit], significantly reducing [Negative Issue]."

!!! tip "Example"

    The primary reason is time efficiency. Commuting to a separate facility is stressful. Consequently, if the company provides an on-site facility, we allow parents to synchronize their commute, significantly reducing daily travel stress.

---

## Step 3: Body Paragraph 2 (Secondary Argument)

**Goal:** Present a second, distinct benefit. If Body 1 was about "Time," make Body 2 about "Health" or "Money."

### Grammar Booster: Gerunds as Subjects

Start sentences with an "-ing" verb to sound sophisticated and concise.

- **Weak:** It is good to have a garden because it helps people learn.
- **Strong:** Having a garden provides a unique opportunity to learn.

### The Template

- **Transition:** "Additionally, the [Educational / Financial] value of this proposal cannot be overstated."
- **Detail** (Gerund): "[Verb-ing]... is a significant asset that..."
- **Benefit:** "It provides a unique opportunity for [People] to [Action]."

!!! tip "Example"

    Additionally, this initiative optimizes work-life balance. By offering care within the same building, the company ensures that parents have peace of mind, knowing they are just a few floors away from their children.

---

## Step 4: Body Paragraph 3 (The Counter-Argument)

**Goal:** Acknowledge the other option (to show you are reasonable), then explain why your choice is still better. This acts as a "Checkmate."

### Grammar Booster: Contrast Markers

Use the "Admittedly... However..." structure. This is a hallmark of a high-scoring essay.

- **Formula:** Admittedly + [Good point about other option]. + However + [Why it is flawed/inferior].

### The Template

- **Concession:** "Admittedly, some [residents/colleagues] might argue that [Option B] would [Benefit of Option B]."
- **Rebuttal:** "However, [Option A] better suits our needs because [Reason]." OR "However, [Option A] addresses a more urgent priority."

!!! tip "Example"

    Admittedly, a playground would provide a recreational space for children. However, playgrounds are often unused during winter months; thus, a garden better suits our needs as it serves all demographics year-round.

---

## Step 5: The Conclusion (Summary)

**Goal:** Summarize your main points and give a final recommendation. Do not introduce new ideas.

### Grammar Booster: Parallel Structure

List your reasons using the same grammatical form (Noun, Noun, and Noun).

### The Template

- **Summary:** "To sum up, based on the fact that [Option A] provides [Benefit 1] and [Benefit 2],..."
- **Final Push:** "I therefore strongly urge the [Council/Management] to proceed with [Option A]."

!!! tip "Example"

    To sum up, based on the superior convenience and the optimization of work-life balance, I therefore strongly urge management to proceed with the on-site daycare.

---

## Model Answer (Score 9+)

**Instruction:** Your community is planning a new program and is deciding between offering Cooking Classes or starting a Recycling Collection Program. Write a response stating which option you support and why.

---

> To the Community Planning Committee, *(Salutation)*
>
> After careful consideration, I firmly support the proposal that a recycling collection program be established rather than offering a cooking class. *(Intro: Stance + Paraphrase)*
>
> The primary reason is environmental sustainability. *(Body 1: Topic Sentence — Environment)* Statistics have shown that local landfills have reached dangerous capacity levels because many recycled materials are currently thrown away with regular trash. *(Explanation: Context)* Consequently, by implementing a formal collection service, the community will have significantly reduced its carbon footprint by diverting tons of waste from dump sites before they overflow. *(Result: Complex Sentence)*
>
> Additionally, this initiative optimizes municipal spending. *(Body 2: Topic Sentence — Economy)* Sending refuse to landfills incurs high disposal fees; therefore, community funds are currently wasted on burying useful materials. *(Detail: Problem)* By recovering recyclables for resale, the community transforms waste management from a financial liability into a revenue stream. *(Gerund Phrase + Benefit)*
>
> Admittedly, some neighbors might argue that cooking classes promote dietary health. *(Body 3: Concession — The "Admittedly" Clause)* However, managing waste is a public responsibility that requires a coordinated system, whereas cooking is a skill that can be learned individually at home. *(Rebuttal — The "However" Clause)*
>
> To sum up, based on the critical environmental protection and long-term cost savings for the community budget, I strongly urge the community to proceed with a recycling collection program. *(Conclusion: Summary + Final Urging)*
