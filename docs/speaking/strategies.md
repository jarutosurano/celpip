## The #1 Rule

!!! warning "Never Stop Talking"

    Silence is your enemy. Even if you make mistakes, keep speaking.
    A response with errors is ALWAYS better than silence.

## Preparation Time (30-60 seconds)

### Do:
- Quickly brainstorm 2-3 main points
- Think of keywords, not full sentences
- Plan your opening and closing
- Take a breath before speaking

### Don't:
- Write full sentences
- Memorize exact words
- Panic if you can't think of everything
- Forget to use all prep time

## During Speaking

### Pace Yourself
- Speak at a natural, moderate speed
- Pause briefly between ideas
- Don't rush - you have enough time
- Don't speak too slowly either

### Use Fillers Naturally
Instead of awkward silence, use:
```
"Well, let me think about that..."
"That's an interesting question..."
"I would say that..."
"In my experience..."
```

### Self-Correct Smoothly
If you make a mistake:
```
"I mean..."
"What I meant to say was..."
"Actually, let me rephrase that..."
```

## Building Fluency

### Chunk Your Speech
Speak in meaningful phrases, not word by word:
```
❌ "I... think... that... this... is... a... good... idea"
✅ "I think / that this is / a good idea"
```

### Use Transition Phrases
Connect your ideas smoothly:
- "First of all..."
- "In addition to that..."
- "On the other hand..."
- "As I mentioned..."
- "To conclude..."

### Extend Your Answers
If you finish early, add more:
- Give another example
- Explain from a different angle
- Mention what others might think
- Add a personal connection

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: Running Out of Things to Say
**Solution:** Use the "TREE" method
- **T**opic sentence
- **R**eason
- **E**xample
- **E**laborate

### Problem: Speaking Too Fast
**Solution:**
- Practice with a timer
- Record and listen to yourself
- Pause at punctuation points

- Listen and imitate native speakers

### Problem: Forgetting Ideas Mid-Speech
**Solution:**
- Note keywords during prep

- Connect to personal experience

## Practice Routine

### Daily (15-20 minutes)
1. Choose a topic randomly
2. Give yourself 30s prep
3. Speak for 60-90 seconds
4. Record and listen back

### Weekly
1. Do a full mock speaking test
2. Time each task strictly
3. Review recordings critically
4. Note patterns in mistakes

## Body Language (Yes, It Matters!)

Even though there's no human examiner:
- Sit up straight - affects your voice
- Gesture naturally - helps fluency
- Smile occasionally - improves tone
- Breathe deeply - reduces nervousness

## Day Before the Test

- Light practice only (10-15 minutes)
- Review your templates
- Get good sleep
- Prepare your voice (warm water, vocal warm-ups)
- Stay confident!
