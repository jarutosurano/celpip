## The Template

**Prep time:** 60 seconds | **Speaking time:** 60 seconds | **Blanks to fill:** 2

Everything outside the brackets is **memorized word for word**. Only fill in the topic and the bad news.

```
"Hi [NAME]. Hope you're doing well. Listen, I have
something a bit delicate to discuss with you
regarding the situation with [TOPIC], so if I could
have a moment of your time, I'd really appreciate
it.

I know you feel strongly about this, and I
completely understand where you're coming from.
However, unfortunately, the issue is [THE BAD NEWS].

I think the best approach would be for us to find
a compromise that works for everyone. This way, we
can avoid any further problems and keep things
fair.

I hope you can agree with me on this, even though
I know it is a difficult situation. I can't wait
to work this out together."
```

## Delivery Tips — Sound Natural, Not Robotic

### Pause with Purpose

| Bad pause | Good pause |
|-----------|-----------|
| "um... I have something..." | "Listen... *(pause)* ...I have something a bit delicate to discuss." |
| "uh... however..." | "However, unfortunately... *(pause)* ...the issue is..." |

### Emphasize Key Words

| Line | How to say it |
|------|--------------|
| "something a bit **delicate**" | Slow down, sound serious but caring |
| "I **completely** understand" | Sound sincere |
| "Unfortunately, the **issue** is..." | Pause before the bad news |
| "I **hope** you can agree" | Sound warm, not demanding |

### The Secret: Smile While Speaking

The examiner can **hear** a smile in your voice. Even when delivering bad news, a warm tone shows you're being diplomatic, not aggressive.
