## The Template

**Prep time:** 30 seconds | **Speaking time:** 60 seconds | **Blanks to fill:** 3

Everything outside the brackets is **memorized word for word**. Only fill in `[EXPERIENCE]`, `[SITUATION DETAIL]`, and `[WHAT YOU DID]`.

```
"I'd like to tell you about a time when [EXPERIENCE].
This happened about a couple of years ago, and it
really left a lasting impression on me.

What happened was, I was [SITUATION DETAIL], and
I decided to [WHAT YOU DID]. At first, I wasn't
sure if it was the right thing to do, but I went
ahead with it anyway.

In the end, it turned out to be one of the best
decisions I've ever made. I learned that sometimes
you just have to take a chance and try something
new. It really taught me to be more confident
and open-minded. I would definitely do it again
if I had the opportunity."
```

## Your 30-Second Prep

During prep, just scribble 3 things on your notepad:

```
1. experience (from the prompt)
2. situation detail (quick context)
3. what I did (the action)
```

That's it. Everything else is already memorized.

## Universal Filler Phrases

These are baked into the template and work for any prompt:

| Phrase | Why it works |
|--------|-------------|
| "a couple of years ago" | Vague enough for any topic |
| "left a lasting impression on me" | Shows it was meaningful |
| "I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do" | Adds natural hesitation |
| "I went ahead with it anyway" | Shows courage/action |
| "one of the best decisions I've ever made" | Positive outcome |
| "take a chance and try something new" | Universal lesson |
| "more confident and open-minded" | Universal growth |
| "I would definitely do it again" | Strong ending |
