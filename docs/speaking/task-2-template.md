## The Template

**Prep time:** 30 seconds | **Speaking time:** 60 seconds | **Blanks to fill:** 1

Everything outside the brackets is **memorized word for word**. Only fill in `[EXPERIENCE]`.

```
"I'd like to tell you about a time when [EXPERIENCE].
This happened a while back, and it really left a
lasting impression on me.

What happened was, I was going about my usual day
when this opportunity came up, and I decided to
just go for it. At first, I wasn't sure if it was
the right thing to do, but I went ahead with it
anyway.

In the end, it turned out to be one of the best
decisions I've ever made. I learned that sometimes
you just have to take a chance and try something
new. It really taught me to be more confident
and open-minded. I would definitely do it again
if I had the opportunity."
```

## Your 30-Second Prep

During prep, just restate the prompt in your own words:

```
[EXPERIENCE] = what the prompt is asking about
```

That's it. Everything else is already memorized.

## Universal Filler Phrases

These are baked into the template and work for any prompt:

| Phrase | Why it works |
|--------|-------------|
| "a while back" | Vague enough for childhood, last year, or anytime |
| "left a lasting impression on me" | Shows it was meaningful |
| "going about my usual day" | Universal setup |
| "this opportunity came up" | Works for any situation |
| "I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do" | Adds natural hesitation |
| "I went ahead with it anyway" | Shows courage/action |
| "one of the best decisions I've ever made" | Positive outcome |
| "take a chance and try something new" | Universal lesson |
| "more confident and open-minded" | Universal growth |
| "I would definitely do it again" | Strong ending |

## Delivery Tips — Sound Natural, Not Robotic

Memorizing is step 1. **How you say it** pushes your score from 7-8 to 8-9.

### Pause with Purpose

Don't rush. A confident pause before a key phrase sounds natural and dramatic.

| Bad pause (nervous) | Good pause (confident) |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| "um... uh... what happened was..." | "This happened a while back... *(pause)* ...and it really left a lasting impression on me." |
| "and uh... in the end..." | "In the end... *(pause)* ...it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made." |

### Emphasize Key Words

Stress the **bold** words — it sounds sincere, not flat.

| Line | How to say it |
|------|--------------|
| "it really left a **lasting** impression on me" | Slow down, sound reflective |
| "I decided to just **go for it**" | Sound confident, proud |
| "one of the **best** decisions I've ever made" | Emphasize "best", smile |
| "more **confident** and **open-minded**" | Sound genuinely grateful |
| "I would **definitely** do it again" | Sound enthusiastic |

### The Secret: Smile While Speaking

The examiner can **hear** a smile in your voice. It makes the whole response sound warmer and more natural — even if you're reading from memory.
