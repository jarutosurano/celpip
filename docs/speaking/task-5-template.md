## Delivery Tips — Sound Natural, Not Robotic

### Pause with Purpose

| Bad pause | Good pause |
|-----------|-----------|
| "um... regarding the price..." | "First, regarding the price... *(pause)* ...my option only costs..." |
| "uh... for these reasons..." | "For these reasons... *(pause)* ...I think we should go with my suggestion." |

### Emphasize Key Words

| Line | How to say it |
|------|--------------|
| "That's a good idea, **but**..." | Pause before "but" — the pivot moment |
| "**much cheaper** than yours" | Stress "much cheaper" |
| "much more **flexible**" | Stress your adjective |
| "Let me know if you **agree**" | Sound friendly, confident |

### The Secret: Smile While Speaking

The examiner can **hear** a smile in your voice. It makes the whole response sound warmer and more natural — even if you're reading from memory.
