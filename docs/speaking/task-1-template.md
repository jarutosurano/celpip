## Delivery Tips — Sound Natural, Not Robotic

Memorizing is step 1. **How you say it** pushes your score from 7-8 to 8-9.

### Pause with Purpose

Don't rush. A confident pause before a key phrase sounds natural and dramatic.

| Bad pause (nervous) | Good pause (confident) |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| "um... uh... what I think is..." | "I've given this some thought... *(pause)* ...and here's what I think you should do." |
| "and uh... another thing is..." | "On top of that... *(pause)* ...I would also suggest..." |

### Emphasize Key Words

Stress the **bold** words — it sounds sincere, not flat.

| Line | How to say it |
|------|--------------|
| "I completely understand how **challenging** that must be" | Slow down, sound empathetic |
| "it will **really** help you feel more confident" | Emphasize "really" |
| "this is **really important** because..." | Sound convinced |
| "everything will work out **well** for you" | Sound warm, confident |
| "I'm **always** here for you" | Slow down, sincere tone, smile |

### The Secret: Smile While Speaking

The examiner can **hear** a smile in your voice. It makes the whole response sound warmer and more natural — even if you're reading from memory.
