title: "Task 7: Expressing Opinions Template"
description: "A memorizable universal template for CELPIP Speaking Task 7. Only fill in 1 blank — your stance. The reasons, grammar structures, and conclusion are all pre-loaded."
---

## The Template

**Prep time:** 30 seconds | **Speaking time:** 90 seconds | **Blanks to fill:** 1

Everything outside the brackets is **memorized word for word**. Just pick a side and rephrase the question.

```
"Yes, I firmly believe that [TOPIC]. This is
something I feel very strongly about, and I'd like
to share my reasons.

First and foremost, since this issue affects so many
people on a daily basis, it will make a real
difference for everyone involved. Therefore, this is
definitely something we should take seriously. I
think most people would agree with me on this.

Second, we must also consider that it helps create
a better environment for everyone. This is
significant because it can lead to long-term
improvements for the whole community.

Finally, even though some people might disagree with
this idea, I still think the advantages clearly
outweigh any potential drawbacks. We cannot afford
to ignore the benefits just because a small group
of people have concerns.

Consequently, for all of these reasons, I am
convinced that this is the right path forward. I
truly hope that more people will come to see it
this way."
```

## Your 30-Second Prep

Scribble 1 thing on your notepad:

```
1. Yes → rephrase the question into your stance
```

That's it. The 3 reasons and conclusion are already memorized.

---

## What to Fill In

| Label | Ask yourself | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| "[TOPIC]" | What's your stance? (rephrase the question) | allowing students to evaluate their teachers is a great idea |

---

## Two Openings — Memorize Both

Pick the one that matches your opinion:

### If you agree (Yes):

```
"Yes, I firmly believe that [TOPIC]."
```

**Example:** "Yes, I firmly believe that allowing students to evaluate their teachers is a great idea."

### If you disagree (No):

```
"No, I completely disagree that [TOPIC]."
```

**Example:** "No, I completely disagree that banning homework from schools is a good solution."

!!! tip "Always pick Yes when possible"

    You can almost always rephrase the question to say "Yes." For example, if the prompt asks "Should homework be banned?" and you disagree, say: "Yes, I firmly believe that **keeping homework** is important for students." This way you only memorize **one** opening.

## Built-In Grammar Structures

The template automatically includes the complex grammar the examiner wants to hear:

| What examiner wants | Where it is in template |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Cause & Effect | "First and foremost, **since** this issue affects..." |
| Transition | "**Second**, we must also consider that..." |
| Concession | "**Even though** some people might disagree..." |
| Strong opinion | "I **firmly** believe" / "I am **convinced**" |
| Logical conclusion | "**Consequently**, for all of these reasons..." |

## Delivery Tips — Sound Natural, Not Robotic

### Pause with Purpose

| Bad pause | Good pause |
|-----------|-----------|
| "um... first and foremost..." | "First and foremost... *(pause)* ...since this issue affects..." |
| "uh... consequently..." | "Consequently... *(pause)* ...for all of these reasons..." |

### Emphasize Key Words

| Line | How to say it |
|------|--------------|
| "I **firmly** believe" | Sound confident, strong |
| "**since** this issue affects so many people" | Sound serious, concerned |
| "**Second**, we must also consider" | Sound thoughtful, adding weight |
| "**even though** some people might disagree" | Sound fair, acknowledging the other side |
| "I am **convinced**" | Sound certain, wrap it up |

### The Secret: Smile While Speaking

The examiner can **hear** a smile in your voice. Even when being assertive, a warm confident tone scores higher than a flat robotic delivery.
