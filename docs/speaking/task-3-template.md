## Your 30-Second Prep

Scan the picture and scribble:

```
1. setting (outdoor / indoor / public)
2. where (park / office / restaurant)
3. left — one thing
4. middle — one thing
5. right — one thing
```

That's it. 3 details is enough. Don't try to describe the whole picture.

| You see | You say |
|---------|---------|
| A man with a dog | "a man walking his dog" |
| Kids on swings | "a few children playing on the swings" |

Keep it simple — just say what you see.

## Delivery Tips — Sound Natural, Not Robotic

### Pause with Purpose

| Bad pause | Good pause |
|-----------|-----------|
| "um... on the left I see..." | "On the left side... *(pause)* ...I can see a man walking his dog." |
| "uh... overall..." | "Overall... *(pause)* ...the atmosphere looks very lively and cheerful." |

### Emphasize Key Words

| Line | How to say it |
|------|--------------|
| "what appears to be an **outdoor** setting" | Stress the setting type |
| "It looks like a **beautiful** day" | Sound appreciative |
| "the atmosphere looks very **lively and cheerful**" | Sound warm |
| "really **enjoying** themselves" | Smile, sound convinced |

### The Secret: Smile While Speaking

The examiner can **hear** a smile in your voice. It makes the whole response sound warmer and more natural — even if you're reading from memory.
