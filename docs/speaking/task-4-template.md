title: "Task 4: Making Predictions Template"
description: "A memorizable universal template for CELPIP Speaking Task 4. Scan left-middle-right, use 3 future tense levels, and let the pre-loaded phrases do the rest."
---

## The Template

**Prep time:** 30 seconds | **Speaking time:** 60 seconds | **Blanks to fill:** 5

Everything outside the brackets is **memorized word for word**. Scan the picture left to right and predict what each person will do next.

```
"In the next few minutes, I think a few things
are going to happen in this scene.

First, the [PERSON ON THE LEFT] is going to finish
[WHAT THEY'RE DOING]. Since they look quite tired,
they are probably going to take a short break soon.

Moving to the middle, the [PERSON IN THE MIDDLE]
will probably [NEXT ACTION]. Once they are done,
they will likely move on to something else.

As for the [PERSON ON THE RIGHT], they might
decide to take a rest. They may [DO SOMETHING],
or they might just continue what they're doing.

Finally, once everything is done, everyone will
likely gather together and call it a day."
```

---

## Your 30-Second Prep

Scan the picture left to right and scribble:

```
1. left — who + what they're doing now
2. middle — who + what they'll do next
3. right — who + what they might do
```

That's it. The future tenses and transitions are already memorized.

## What to Fill In

| Blank | Just say what you see |
|-------|----------------------|
| `[PERSON ON THE LEFT]` | the man on the left / the woman near the tree |
| `[WHAT THEY'RE DOING]` | chopping wood / planting crops / cooking |
| `[PERSON IN THE MIDDLE]` | the woman in the middle / the group of workers |
| `[NEXT ACTION]` | carry the boxes inside / clean up the area |
| `[PERSON ON THE RIGHT]` | the people on the right / the children nearby |
| `[DO SOMETHING]` | chat with the others / grab some food / head inside |

## 3 Future Tense Levels — Built In

The examiner wants to hear **3 different future forms**. They're already baked into the template:

| Person | Certainty | Grammar | Template line |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Left | High (planned) | **going to** | "is going to finish..." |
| Middle | Medium (logical) | **will** | "will probably..." |
| Right | Low (uncertain) | **might** | "might decide to..." |

You don't need to think about grammar — just follow the template and all 3 levels come out automatically.

---

## Universal Fillers When Stuck

If you can't think of specific actions, use these safe defaults:

| Blank | Safe default |
|-------|-------------|
| `[WHAT THEY'RE DOING]` | what they're currently working on |
| `[NEXT ACTION]` | help the others with their task |
| `[DO SOMETHING]` | chat with the others |
| Closing | "gather together and call it a day" |

## Example: Farm Scene

**Picture:** A farm with people doing various tasks — planting, chopping wood, riding horses.

**30-second prep notepad:**

```
1. left — two men planting crops
2. middle — man chopping wood
3. right — women on horseback
```

**Full response:**

> "In the next few minutes, I think a few things are going to happen in this scene.
>
> First, the two men on the left are going to finish planting the crops in that section. Since they look quite tired, they are probably going to take a short break soon.
>
> Moving to the middle, the man chopping wood will probably chop a few more logs. Once they are done, they will likely move on to something else.
>
> As for the women on horseback on the right, they might decide to take a rest. They may ride closer to the orchard to help with the apples, or they might just continue what they're doing.
>
> Finally, once everything is done, everyone will likely gather together and call it a day."

## Example: Restaurant Scene

**Picture:** A busy restaurant with staff serving food, a chef cooking, and customers eating.

**30-second prep notepad:**

```
1. left — chef cooking
2. middle — waiter carrying plates
3. right — customers eating
```

**Full response:**

> "In the next few minutes, I think a few things are going to happen in this scene.
>
> First, the chef on the left is going to finish preparing the current dish. Since they look quite tired, they are probably going to take a short break soon.
>
> Moving to the middle, the waiter carrying plates will probably serve the food to the waiting customers. Once they are done, they will likely move on to something else.
>
> As for the customers on the right, they might decide to take a rest. They may order dessert, or they might just continue what they're doing.
>
> Finally, once everything is done, everyone will likely gather together and call it a day."

## Same Scan as Task 3

Tasks 3 and 4 use the **same picture** and the **same left-to-right scan**:

| Task | What you do | Scan |
|------|------------|------|
| Task 3: Describe | Say what you **see** | Left → Middle → Right |
| Task 4: Predict | Say what will **happen next** | Left → Middle → Right |

## Delivery Tips — Sound Natural, Not Robotic

### Pause with Purpose

| Bad pause | Good pause |
|-----------|-----------|
| "um... the man will..." | "Moving to the middle... *(pause)* ...the man will probably..." |
| "uh... finally..." | "Finally... *(pause)* ...once everything is done..." |

### Emphasize Key Words

| Line | How to say it |
|------|--------------|
| "is **going to** finish" | Sound certain, confident |
| "will **probably**" | Sound logical, thoughtful |
| "**might** decide to" | Sound speculative, wondering |
| "everyone will likely **gather together**" | Warm, wrapping up |

### The Secret: Smile While Speaking

The examiner can **hear** a smile in your voice. It makes the whole response sound warmer and more natural — even if you're reading from memory.

## Memorization Checklist

Practice saying the template out loud until you can do it without looking:

- [ ] Opening: "In the next few minutes, I think a few things are going to happen in this scene."
- [ ] Left (going to): "First, the ___ is going to finish ___. Since they look quite tired, they are probably going to take a short break soon."
- [ ] Middle (will): "Moving to the middle, the ___ will probably ___. Once they are done, they will likely move on to something else."
- [ ] Right (might): "As for the ___ on the right, they might decide to take a rest. They may ___, or they might just continue what they're doing."
- [ ] Closing: "Finally, once everything is done, everyone will likely gather together and call it a day."
