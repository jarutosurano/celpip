## Before the Audio Plays

### Read the Questions First
- Use the time before audio starts to scan questions
- Identify what information you need
- Note any keywords to listen for

### Predict the Content
- Look at the context description
- Think about vocabulary you might hear
- Prepare your mind for the topic

## During the Audio

### Take Brief Notes
- Jot down key words, not full sentences
- Note names, numbers, dates, places
- Use abbreviations and symbols

### Don't Panic If You Miss Something
- Keep listening - don't dwell on missed parts
- The answer might become clear later
- Some information is repeated

### Listen for Signal Words

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "However", "But" | Contrast coming |
| "First", "Then", "Finally" | Sequence |
| "Most importantly" | Key point |
| "The main reason" | Core information |
| "In other words" | Clarification |

## Answering Questions

### Answer Immediately
- Select your answer as soon as you hear it
- Don't wait until the audio ends
- You can change answers later

### Eliminate Wrong Options
- Cross out obviously wrong answers
- Often 2 options can be quickly eliminated
- Choose from remaining options

### Trust Your First Instinct
- Your first answer is often correct
- Don't overthink or second-guess
- Change only if you're certain

## Common Traps

!!! warning "Watch Out"
    - **Distractor words:** Same words in wrong context
    - **Partial information:** Answer sounds right but is incomplete
    - **Extreme language:** "Always", "never" - often wrong
    - **Changed order:** Information presented in different order than questions

## Practice Exercise

Listen to English content daily:
- Podcasts (CBC, NPR)
- News broadcasts
- TED Talks
- Movies without subtitles

Focus on understanding the **main idea** first, then details.
