## What Part 1 Is

You read a short everyday email or message, then complete a brief reply that contains **drop-down blanks**. The question set mixes understanding of the original message (purpose, details) with finishing the reply so it matches facts and tone. There are **11 items** with a target time of **~11 minutes**.

## The 30-Second "3x10 Map"

Before touching options, build a tiny map (ten seconds per line):

1. **Who** — Writer → recipient (roles: neighbour, coordinator, HR, building manager)
2. **Why** — What the writer wants (requesting help, confirming booking, notifying change, complaining, apologizing)
3. **Tone** — Formal / neutral / friendly; strength (cautious, direct, urgent)

!!! tip

    Write three words on your notepaper. This clears working memory so you don't lose the thread when options start paraphrasing.

## Constraint Extraction

Pull out details that control the logic of answers:

| Constraint Type | Examples |
|----------------|---------|
| Time & date windows | Exact times, days, deadlines, "after/before/until/from", am vs pm |
| Money & amounts | Prices, budgets, deposits, refunds, limits ("up to", "no more than") |
| Counts & availability | Seats, lanes, rooms, tickets, spaces |
| Conditions & exceptions | *only, except, at least, at most, unless, including/excluding* |
| Obligation strength | *must/required* vs *should/recommended* vs *may/might* |
| Logistics facts | Address, entrance, equipment, parking, ID needed |

Turn the stem into a short **constraint string**: e.g., "≥3 lanes, after 7 pm, weekdays."

## Completing the Reply Drop-Downs

Think of the reply as a spine: **acknowledge → answer → next step**.

- **Acknowledge:** Mirror the purpose briefly ("Thanks for the update about…")
- **Answer exactly:** Confirm or provide what was asked, using the same constraints
- **Next step / close:** Confirm action or ask one necessary follow-up

### Drop-Down Tests (run all four on every blank)

1. **Meaning test** — Insert each option and re-read the entire sentence. Reject anything that breaks a fact from the original
2. **Tone test** — If the original is polite/neutral, the reply cannot be blunt or pushy
3. **Strength test** — Match must/should/may level; don't upgrade or downgrade
4. **Grammar fit** — Subject–verb agreement and tense must read naturally after insertion

## Tone & Formality Alignment

Clues in salutations, sign-offs, and verbs tell you the register:

| Register | Clues | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Friendly/collegial** | "Hi Alex… Thanks so much!" Short sentences, contractions | Casual workplace or neighbours |
| **Neutral/professional** | "Hello Ms. Patel… Thank you for your message." Complete sentences, polite verbs | Standard business |
| **Formal** | "Dear Sir/Madam… I regret to inform you…" No contractions, impersonal style | Official notices |

!!! warning "Register Rule"

    The reply must mirror the original register. A casual "Hey!" reply to a formal complaint is always wrong.

## High-Frequency Traps

| Trap | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Polite upgrade** | Message says *we may reschedule*; wrong option says *we will reschedule* |
| **Calendar shift** | *this Friday* vs *next Friday*; *no later than 5 pm* vs *not until 5 pm* |
| **Half-match** | Option repeats nouns but flips *only/except/at least* |
| **Helpful addition** | Reply option adds a promise never made in the message |
| **Tone mismatch** | Message is formal; reply option is slangy or pushy |
| **Pronoun confusion** | Reply says *we* when the original expects *I*, or answers for the wrong party |

## Paraphrase Patterns in Correspondence

| Category | Safe Swaps | False Friends |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Time | *as soon as possible* ↔ *at your earliest convenience* | *no later than 5 pm* ≠ *not until 5 pm* |
| Money | *no charge* ↔ *free* | *free* ≠ *reduced fee / discounted rate* |
| Action | *confirm* ↔ *let me know*; *attach* ↔ *include* | *postpone* ≠ *cancel* |
| Strength | — | *must/required* ≠ *should/recommended* ≠ *may/could* |
| Limits | — | *at least 2* ≠ *exactly 2* |

## Micro-Routine for the 11 Items

1. **Skim** the message top→bottom once (10–15s). Build the Who–Why–Tone map
2. **Underline/copy constraints** (time, money, counts, exception words)
3. **Do all fact-first items** you can prove from text (names, times, amounts)
4. **Move to reply blanks**: run Meaning → Tone → Strength → Grammar on each drop-down
5. **Return to inference/attitude items** with remaining time
6. **Final sweep**: no blanks; check that every reply sentence reads naturally

## Timing Model (~11 minutes)

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Message skim + 3x10 Map | ~1:00 |
| Fact items (fast wins) | ~3:30 |
| Reply drop-downs (careful read-throughs) | ~5:30 |
| Inference/attitude + final sweep | ~1:00 |

!!! tip "The Prove-It Rule"

    For any option, you should be able to **touch the words** that justify it. If you can't point to the line, it's a guess. Use ±1 sentence around the anchor to avoid scope and timeline mistakes.

## Quick Error Fixes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Picked a detail as the "main purpose" | Ask: "If I reply, what action would I take?" Purpose = the action the writer wants |
| Lost a point on a time window | Re-read before/after/until and am/pm; copy the window to notes |
| Reply sounded too strong/weak | Compare must/should/may in the message; match it |
| Added promises | Replies should confirm, not invent. If the message didn't ask, don't offer |
| Forgot the second text | Blanks often sit below the first message — always scroll to the reply area |
