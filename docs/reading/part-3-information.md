## What Part 3 Is

You read a short informational passage split into **four paragraphs (A–D)** and receive **nine statements**. For each statement, decide which paragraph supports it — or choose **E: Not Stated** if the idea isn't supported anywhere. Target time is **~10 minutes**.

## The Paragraph GPS (60–90 seconds)

This setup saves minutes across all nine items.

1. **Lead lines** — Read the first sentence of each paragraph to identify the topic
2. **Label A–D** in one word/phrase: e.g., Habitat / Features / Food / Threats
3. **Mark contrast markers** — *however, although, in contrast, on the other hand* (these often host answers)
4. **Note proper nouns and technical terms** — names, programs, species (anchors that don't paraphrase)

!!! tip

    This is not "reading the whole passage." It's setting up a finder's map so you always know where to look.

## From Statement to Answer: Locate → Verify → Decide → Defend

### 1. Locate (pick the likely paragraph)
- Extract 2–3 keywords from the statement
- Write one parallel term for each (e.g., *elderly* ↔ *seniors*; *cost* ↔ *fee/charge*)
- Jump to the paragraph whose topic label and anchors match best

### 2. Verify (read precisely)
- Read the target line + one sentence above and below
- Confirm every part: subject, quantity/degree, time window, cause/effect

### 3. Decide (choose A–D or E)
- If one paragraph clearly states or paraphrases the statement → choose that letter
- If no paragraph supports it after a quick sweep → consider E: Not Stated

### 4. Defend (prove it)
- Point to the exact words or a clean paraphrase that preserves meaning, strength, and scope
- If you can't, you're guessing

## Parallel Terms (synonyms do the heavy lifting)

Writers rarely repeat the exact word the question uses.

### Safe Paraphrases

| Category | Swaps |
|----------|-------|
| People & groups | elderly ↔ seniors; residents ↔ people who live here; staff ↔ employees |
| Quantities & change | increase ↔ rise/grow; decrease ↔ drop/decline; at least ↔ minimum of |
| Money & time | cost ↔ fee/charge; free ↔ no charge; before ↔ prior to; after ↔ following |
| Cause & effect | because ↔ due to/owing to; result ↔ outcome/impact |

### Meaning-Changing "False Friends"

- will ≠ may
- must/required ≠ should/recommended
- exactly ≠ at least
- *not until 5 pm* ≠ *no later than 5 pm*

If a paraphrase changes strength, polarity, or scope, it's **not** support.

## The "Not Stated" Filter

"Not Stated" is for statements the passage **doesn't commit to** — not for things that feel unlikely.

### Three-Step Filter

1. **Feasibility check** — Could this idea reasonably appear given the topics? If yes, keep searching
2. **Global sweep** — Scan the topic sentence of each paragraph + any lines where keywords or parallels would sit
3. **Absence confirmed** — If no paragraph states or cleanly implies the idea → choose E with confidence

!!! warning "Tiny Inferences Are Fine"

    "Evenings are often crowded" → safe inference: crowding is common after work. But "A pilot will run for two weeks" → unsafe inference: the city will expand it next year.

## Where Traps Hide in Statements

| Trap Type | What to Watch |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Quantifiers** | some/most/all/rarely/often — match strength exactly |
| **Time words** | before/after/until/from/since — a single preposition flips truth |
| **Comparatives** | more/less/fewer/greater — watch the baseline (compared to what?) |
| **Cause/effect** | *leads to* vs *results from* — direction matters |
| **Examples vs claims** | A single example does not prove "all" or "usually" |

## Paragraph-Choice Logic

- **Choose A–D** when one paragraph contains sufficient support (explicit or clean paraphrase)
- **Choose E** when no paragraph supports it
- If two paragraphs seem to contain the idea, you probably misread scope — recheck the statement for a limiting word (time, group, condition) that selects only one

## Timing Plan (~10 minutes)

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Build Paragraph GPS (map A–D) | ~1:00–1:30 |
| Items 1–5 (direct matches) | ~4:00–4:30 |
| Items 6–8 (trickier wording/inference) | ~3:00 |
| Item 9 + sweep (confirm Not Stated choices) | ~1:00–1:30 |

**Checkpoint:** At 5:00, aim for Q5 done. If behind, keep moving — no blanks.

## Quick Error Fixes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Picked the right topic, wrong paragraph | You matched a noun, not the claim. Re-read for what is *said*, not what is *mentioned* |
| Missed a quantifier | Underline strength words in both the statement and paragraph — they must align |
| Over-inferred | If you can't touch the words that justify it, it's a leap. Choose E |
| Gave up too early on Not Stated | Do the full global sweep before committing to E |
| Ran out of time | The paragraph map pays for itself — never skip it |

## Micro-Routines for Practice

- **Label sprint** (60s): Read any article, write a one-word label for each paragraph
- **Parallel hunt** (45s): Pick a statement, list two paraphrases for each keyword
- **E-check** (60s): For one tricky claim, do a global sweep. If no support, explain why in ten words
- **Strength audit** (30s): Highlight all may/might/usually/some vs must/will/all, then rewrite to match
