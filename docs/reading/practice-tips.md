## Pacing & Time Control

### The Rules of the Clock

- Each part has its **own timer** — time does not carry over
- **Forward only** — when a part ends, it locks permanently
- **No penalty** for wrong answers — a blank is the only guaranteed loss
- **Two-pass always wins** — Pass 1 = fast obvious items, Pass 2 = targeted returns

### Minute-by-Minute Plans

#### Part 1 — Correspondence (11 items, ~11 min)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0:00–1:00 | Build Who → Why → Tone map; underline constraints |
| 1:00–4:00 | Answer fact-first questions (prove from text) |
| 4:00–9:30 | Complete reply drop-downs (Meaning → Tone → Strength → Grammar) |
| 9:30–11:00 | Inference/attitude items + final sweep |

**Checkpoint:** At 5:30, be on or past Q6.

#### Part 2 — Apply a Diagram (8 items, ~9 min)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0:00–0:30 | Title → Legend & Footnotes (units, exceptions) |
| 0:30–4:30 | Answer single-constraint items |
| 4:30–8:00 | Answer multi-constraint items |
| 8:00–9:00 | Finish reply drop-downs + footnote sweep |

**Checkpoint:** At 4:30, be on Q4. If not, skip puzzles and bank easy ones.

#### Part 3 — Reading for Information (9 items, ~10 min)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0:00–1:15 | Build Paragraph GPS (label A–D with one-word topics) |
| 1:15–5:15 | Answer direct matches |
| 5:15–9:00 | Tackle trickier paraphrases/inferences |
| 9:00–10:00 | Confirm Not Stated choices with global sweep |

**Checkpoint:** At 5:00, aim for Q5 done.

#### Part 4 — Reading for Viewpoints (10 items, ~13 min)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0:00–1:00 | Build Opinions Map (voices, stance, hedges/boosters) |
| 1:00–7:30 | First pass: agree/disagree, purpose, best title |
| 7:30–11:30 | Second pass: inference + comment drop-downs |
| 11:30–13:00 | Final sweep: absolute-wording check, no blanks |

**Checkpoint:** At 7:30, have 6–7 items locked. Start the comment by 9:30.

### Per-Question Time Budgets

| Question Type | Target Time |
|--------------|-------------|
| Specific Information (S) | 45–60 sec |
| General Meaning (G) | 45–75 sec |
| Inference (I) | 60–90 sec |
| Drop-down blank | 20–30 sec per blank |
| Not Stated decision | 30–50 sec (after global sweep) |

Over 90 seconds on one item = flag it, move on, return in Pass 2.

### The Rescue Plan (when time runs out)

1. **Answer the freebies** — anything with clear anchors (names, numbers) gets answered now
2. **Eliminate aggressively** — reject two choices fast, pick the survivor
3. **Fill all blanks** — insert the most neutral option if unsure
4. **Last 20 seconds** — pick the most moderate-sounding option for anything untouched

!!! danger "Green / Yellow / Red Checkpoints"

    - **Green:** Halfway through items by halfway on the timer — keep pace
    - **Yellow:** 1–2 items behind at halfway — skip inference, bank easy items
    - **Red:** 3+ items behind with ≤3 min left — trigger Rescue Plan immediately

## Paraphrase & Vocabulary Toolkit

### How CELPIP Hides Answers

CELPIP rarely repeats wording. It tests whether you can match the same idea in new words — without changing **strength**, **scope**, or **polarity**.

### The Three Switches

| Switch | Ladder | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Strength** | must → should → may | *may help* ≠ *will solve* |
| **Scope** | all → most → some → few | *some residents* ≠ *all residents* |
| **Polarity** | Positive ↔ negative; time logic | *before 6 pm* ≠ *after 6 pm* |

If an option changes any switch, it's wrong — even if the topic matches.

### Time & Date Cheat Sheet

| Expression | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| before 6 pm | any time < 6:00 |
| after 6 pm | any time > 6:00 (often 6:01+) |
| from 6 pm | includes 6:00 |
| by 6 pm / no later than 6 pm | ≤ 6:00 |
| until 6 pm | up to 6:00, not after |
| not until 6 pm | nothing before 6:00 |
| between 2–4 pm | usually inclusive |
| weekdays | Mon–Fri (Friday evening is NOT weekend) |

### Quantity Expressions

| Expression | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| at least 3 | 3, 4, 5… (≥3) |
| at most 3 | 3, 2, 1, 0 (≤3) |
| fewer than 3 | 0, 1, 2 |
| more than 3 | 4, 5… |
| up to 3 | usually ≤3 |

### Morpheme Decoder (for unfamiliar words)

Break words into **prefix + root + suffix**:

| Prefixes | Meaning | Roots | Meaning | Suffixes | Meaning |
|----------|---------|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| pre- | before | spect | look | -tion / -ment | action/state |
| post- | after | scrib/graph | write | -able / -ible | can be |
| re- | again | port | carry | -less | without |
| un- / in- / im- | not | cred | believe | -ful | full of |
| over- | too much | chron | time | -er / -or | person/thing |
| mis- | wrongly | meter | measure | -ward(s) | direction |

Example: *misallocation* → mis (wrong) + alloc (assign) + ation (act) → "wrong assignment"

### Phrasal Verbs (test favourites)

| Phrasal Verb | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| pick up | collect |
| drop off | deliver/leave |
| fill out | complete a form |
| turn in | submit |
| set up | arrange |
| call off | cancel |
| look into | investigate |
| put off | postpone |
| roll out | launch |
| opt out | decline |
| phase out | gradually stop |

!!! warning "Watch Out"

    If an option replaces a phrasal verb with a **different** action (cancel vs postpone), that's a meaning shift — reject it.

### The 4-Step Option Surgery

Run this on every answer:
1. **Swap-back test** — Replace the option's phrase with the passage's phrase. Same meaning?
2. **Switches check** — Strength, Scope, Polarity all match?
3. **Anchor proof** — Can you point to the exact line that supports it?
4. **Tone sanity** — Does register (formal/neutral/friendly) still fit?

One failed step → eliminate.

## Drill Routines (practice these daily)

### Gist Sprint (40 seconds)
Read first lines + contrast markers of any article, then write a one-line summary. If your line could be a title for the whole passage, you did it right.

### Anchor Hunt (30 seconds)
Pick a constraint string (e.g., "≥3 lanes, after 7 pm, weekdays"). On any timetable, prove where it's satisfied and where it isn't.

### Paraphrase A/B (45 seconds)
Take any sentence. Rewrite it twice: once safe (meaning unchanged), once shifted (change strength or polarity). Train your ear to spot the shift.

### Tone Toggle (30 seconds)
Turn a neutral line into a request, then into a complaint, by swapping 3–4 words. Notice which words flip the purpose.

### Inference Filter (45 seconds)
Read a short claim. List the clues that support it from the text. If you can't list clues, it's not an inference — it's a guess.

### 60-Second A/C/E Drill
For any paragraph + 4 options, label each Aligned / Contradicts / Extra without overthinking.

## Self-Assessment Checklist

After each practice test, ask:
- [ ] Did I finish each part on time?
- [ ] Which question type (G/S/I) did I miss most?
- [ ] Did I fall for strength, scope, or polarity traps?
- [ ] Did I miss any footnotes or constraint words?
- [ ] Were my Not Stated choices confirmed with a global sweep?
- [ ] Did I leave any blanks?

Track patterns and fix the top two causes first.
