## What Part 4 Is

You read an opinion-style article (the author plus at least one contrasting viewpoint) and then a short **reader comment** you must complete using drop-down blanks. Most questions are **Inference** (what speakers would agree with, what a sentence implies, attitude/tone), mixed with a few **General Meaning** items. There are **10 items** with a target time of **~13 minutes**.

## The Opinions Map (your core routine)

Spend 45–60 seconds before touching options:

### 1. Identify Voices
- **Author** (main voice in the article)
- **Other viewpoints** (opponents, sceptics, supporters, stakeholders)
- **Reader comment** (a separate voice for drop-downs)

### 2. Capture Stance + Reason
For each voice: **position** (for/against/mixed) → **why** (one short reason)

### 3. Mark Strength & Hedges
- **Hedges** (soften): *may, might, could, tends to, appears, some, often*
- **Boosters** (strengthen): *clearly, definitely, strong evidence, shows that*

### 4. Spot Contrast Markers
*however, although, whereas, in contrast, on the other hand, still, even so*

!!! tip "Example Map"

    - Author: supports longer hours → reduces crowding
    - Resident A: supports (parent) → after-work access
    - Resident B: opposes → hire staff instead
    - Commenter: neutral-leaning support → asks about budget

## Four Lenses for Every Claim

When verifying an option, check all four:

| Lens | Ask Yourself |
|------|-------------|
| **Claim** | What exactly is being asserted? (policy, cause/effect, prediction, value judgement) |
| **Evidence** | What reasons are given? (data, examples, logic) |
| **Scope** | Who/when/where? (residents vs commuters; evenings vs weekends) |
| **Strength** | Cautious (*may help*) or absolute (*will fix*)? |

A correct option must match all four **for the same speaker**.

## Question Patterns

### "Would agree / most likely agrees"
- **Anchor:** Your opinions map
- **Method:** Find the voice, re-state their stance, eliminate options that exaggerate or shift the claim
- **Trap:** Assigning the author's view to a commenter (or vice versa)

### "Implied / suggested by the statement"
- **Anchor:** The sentence + its context (before/after)
- **Method:** Take one logical step, not three. Respect hedges
- **Trap:** Outside knowledge ("In real life…") — if not traceable to text, reject

### "Author's attitude / tone"
- **Anchor:** Adverbs, adjectives, hedges/boosters around the claim
- **Method:** Choose labels matching strength (e.g., *cautiously supportive*, *skeptical*, *concerned*)
- **Trap:** Extreme labels (*outraged, dismissive*) when language is balanced

### "Best title / main purpose"
- **Anchor:** The whole article
- **Method:** Reject options too narrow (one paragraph) or that flip stance
- **Trap:** Glitter detail titles (names, numbers) that miss the argument

### "Purpose of paragraph/sentence"
- **Anchor:** Position in the argument
- **Method:** Is the line introducing, contrasting, conceding, giving evidence, or concluding?
- **Trap:** Confusing a concession ("Even supporters admit…") with a reversal

## The Three Golden Tests

Run these on every option:

1. **Speaker test** — Who would say this? If the voice doesn't match → eliminate
2. **Strength test** — Does modality match? (*may* vs *will*; *some* vs *most* vs *all*)
3. **Scope test** — Same group/time/place? If it widens or narrows without support → wrong

## The Drop-Down Comment

Complete the reader comment with: **acknowledge → position → reason/next step**

- **Meaning fit** — Insert each option, read the full sentence. Must not contradict the article
- **Speaker fit** — The commenter's voice must stay coherent across blanks (don't switch from pro to anti mid-comment)
- **Tone fit** — Keep it civil and proportional to the article's register
- **Strength fit** — If the commenter is cautious, avoid bold claims

## High-Frequency Traps

| Trap | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Stance swap** | Option assigns the author's view to a commenter or flips who supports what |
| **Over-boost** | Passage says *may help*; option says *will solve* |
| **Scope stretch** | Claim about evenings becomes "all hours" |
| **Strawman** | Option criticizes an argument the text never makes |
| **Concession confusion** | A sentence admitting a downside is treated as if the author opposes the policy |
| **New info injection** | Option adds evidence not mentioned anywhere |

!!! warning "Concession ≠ Reversal"

    "Although X, the author still supports Y." Options that treat the concession as a flip are wrong.

## Timing Plan (~13 minutes)

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Build Opinions Map | ~1:00 |
| First pass: stance/structure items (agree/disagree, best title, purpose) | ~6:30 |
| Second pass: inference + comment drop-downs | ~4:00 |
| Final sweep: absolute-wording check, no blanks, comment reads smoothly | ~1:30 |

**Checkpoints:** At 7:30, have 6–7 items locked. Start the comment by 9:30.

## Quick Error Fixes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Mixed up speakers | Rebuild the Opinions Map; highlight names at each claim |
| Chose absolute language | If the speaker uses *may/might*, your option can't use *will/must* |
| Misread a concession | Label it: "acknowledges downside but keeps stance" |
| Drop-down contradiction | After insertion, read the entire sentence — if it flips stance or tone, reject |
| Ran out of time | Answer stance/structure items first; leave dense inference for second pass |

## Micro-Routines for Practice

### Agreement Chain
1. Find the exact sentence where a voice states their stance
2. Extract the reason they give
3. Eliminate any option missing that reason or changing its strength

### Implication Glide
1. Read the line plus the next line
2. Ask: "If this is true, what is the smallest thing that follows?"
3. Reject options needing two+ steps or outside facts

### Comment Drop-Down Sanity
1. Insert an option
2. Read the whole sentence in your head
3. If tone or facts wobble → reject, try the next option
