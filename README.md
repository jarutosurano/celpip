5. **Weekend = intensive days** - Save longer practice for Sat/Sun

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Over-studying the night before (causes fatigue)
- Skipping mock tests (you need timed practice)
- Ignoring speaking practice (most neglected section)
- Reading word-by-word (kills your time)
- Staying silent when stuck in speaking (big penalty)
